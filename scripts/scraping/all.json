I did this just to see if either a) people would catch the reference or b) if/how people would react anyway to them, and then made my quotes less and less subtle while still not including any obvious signs that it was from the show (i.e. including names, etc.) until somebody clearly caught the reference (thanks XhiDae). In case anybody's curious (which probably nobody is anyway but heh) the quotes are #2358 (from The Southern Raiders), #2389 (from the finale), #2426 (from Tales of Ba Sing Se), #2431 (from The Ember Island Players). I'm glad to see the last one at least was obvious enough for people to catch."

            "My best friend fell in love with me, but I didn't share his feelings(although I loved him a lot, but not in a romantic way, I guess). I tried to not tell him how I felt about him, because I don't fell comfortable expressing my feelings. But he knew I didn't love him back(while everyone else thought that we were a couple).After a few months he started acting differently. He was rude and wasn't caring that much anymore. When I got an operation, I was expecting he'd want to come and see me, but he didn't even mention it. On his birthday, I was waiting for him, to give him a big hug, but it seemed like he was avoiding me. Then my patience came to an end. I asked him what had happened, and he told me that he tried to make the love go away. He said he wanted to be just friends, but it was hard for him. He said that nothing was going to be the same, that he'll try to treat me better, but he won't be the guy who was in love with me. We started fighting a lot. We would fight and then act as if everything was fine, and we'd talk as cute as we used to, but then fight again. Eventually, on Christmas eve, we had a huge fight because of something really stupid, which he considered something really important. And I tried to fix the situation, while he was blaming me for making it worse. I texted him 4-5 times, with periods between them, and then I gave up, because he wouldn't try. Time passed, and it was really hard for me. I missed him a lot, as he was my everything. But he seemed alright without me. I wanted him to feel what I felt, to suffer the way I suffered. I wanted him to realize he couldn't live without me. But he didn't do anything. After a month or more he texted me, and my heart was beating really fast, but I acted cool. The conversation didn't last long. As time passed, I started feeling that I hate him. It took me a lot of time to get over him. But even now, when I see him happy without me, I get jealous. I just wanted him to fight for me. What if I'd love him back?"

            "Definitely doable indeed. I actually took all of the courses listed in #2317, plus some extra math courses, as well as 6.842, 6.845, 6.851, 6.852, 6.856, 6.875, 6.889, and also some physics courses for fun like 8.325, 8.334, and 8.962. Despite doing a UROP where I published 16 papers, which all appeared in FOCS, STOC, Annals of Mathematics, Nature, and Cell (according to some professors I may be nominated for both the Fields Medal and a Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine) as well as a side project where I published 2 papers in PRL, I got straight A's and A+'s including in 6.438. Though I admit I had a bit of an advantage as I had done a little coding in the past, and also my PRL papers weren't super impressive, like probably not good enough to guarantee tenure or get nominated for a Nobel Prize in Physics or anything. And I'm definitely not that smart or anything - like both the classes I took and doing Nobel Prize worthy research aren't that hard - you just have to spend a little bit of time and not complain."

For HASS I decided to balance it out and take 21M.301 which was pretty easy for me since I already been doing music. Despite having a UROP which ended up with a publication in ICML, I ended up getting almost all As and A+ grades though in 6.438 I somehow managed to get a B+ (fml right?). Tbh I am not even that smart its just that its over-exagerated by many people how difficult these classes are - theyre hard of course but doable. I didnt even have any of the pre-reqs and hadnt written a line of code before. Maybe thats why I got a B+ in 438. It was all good though since it was just my first semester and was on PNR."

I understood that people thought it might be necessary at the time, but it's only led to more religious extremism and conflict, and the Pakistanis would have been better off remaining in India. Also, Pakistan lacks the separation between religion and state that Jinnah envisioned and that India has (even if Modi's government is quite problematic). Unfortunately, Imran Khan supports blasphemy laws."

I developed feelings, not a crush, but real feelings for a girl that was with someone and I knew she was with him. I didn't plan to develop feelings for her, she was just a really great friend and a really smart person and as we hung out, I developed feelings for her subconsciously. Am I stupid for falling in love with someone that I knew was with someone else? Yes. But that's what love does: it makes you stupid. It killed me not not being able to tell her her and took me forever to get over those feelings, but I did."

            "The other day (8/23) there was a ton of free food in building 66. Quite a few people showed up, but there was plenty to go around. Then an East Campus resident showed up and piled up 3 platters (there was a 2nd person with him, cannot recall if they took anything too), close to half of the food available. Several people tried to stop him from doing so, explaining that he was taking food from others streaming from across campus. He left anyway. I just wanted to tell that person: you are despicable. Sure, you're taking the food not only for yourself, so that might make you feel less selfish. But to use the free food mailing list as a personal catering service for you community is basically stealing food from the mouths of the hungriest people on campus. It's one thing if you're doing so naively, but to continue doing so over in-person protests is disturbing."

            "The ego wants to destroy itself. Sometimes, I don't want to handle all this energy. All this extreme selfishness makes me sick sometimes. This narcissism of mine is very strong I must admit. So strong that sometimes I want to destroy all of you and everything. The world can be destroyed, but it annoys me that the destruction of the universe in a reverse Big Bang explosion is out of my control. And that only leaves the hatred behind. Sometimes, I want this energy, and I'm happy to have it because the only way I can release it and be at peace is by creating. Sometimes the universe makes me fall in love with everything. I'm happy to be here, and I want to help everyone else be happy too. Alleviate the suffering. Sometimes the cycle repeats itself and starts over and over again. I want to balance these two powers. I believe that is the only way. God, show me the way."

            "Why purple? Why is the top part of the MIT Confessions page purple? Cause the top of all Google forms is purple. Why is the top part of all Google forms purple? Can you change it? If you can, why is purple then the default? Cause the team behind the creation of Google forms chose it to be purple. Why? Maybe because the majority of the team voted for purple. Why? Because they like purple. Why do they like purple? Cause they think purple is a good color. Why? Why do people have favorite colors? How do people choose a favorite color? Damn it that's a hard question. But there's gotta be a top node dealing with color preferences in people. Either psychologically or neurologically, there has to be a reason why people have favorite colors. Does a person's favorite color say something about that person? If so, what is it, and why? How many things can it say?",

            "In high school I was taught abstinence, the unreliability of contraception, and the horrors of STDs, and nothing else about sex or consent or appropriate sexual behavior. Now that I've come to MIT and learned a lot more about sex, I'm slowly realizing how insanely problematic my last high school relationship was, in terms of lack of consent and wildly inappropriate sexual overstepping. Now that I know how much stuff was done to me that was very not okay, I've felt increasingly violated and instinctively wary of committing to another relationship. But I also feel a bit unjustified, because what I felt when these things actually happened was a fraction of what I feel now, and it's like changing my mind after the fact which is unfair or something. Idk. Anybody else have similar experiences?"

            "It's very very scary how sex clouds people's minds. So much advertising revolves around evocative sexual imagery, which apparently gets people to buy stuff well enough that \"\"sex sells\"\" is a standard. People will do horrible things like rape a friend, just driven by a desire to fuck. Women are groped in broad public daylight just because what, some creep wants to touch a boob that bad? Imagine if suddenly grabbing a stranger's arm or face in public was normalized, or treated as somewhat understandable, like groping is. As an asexual, I don't think I can ever understand the raw power that sex has on people, and floating through a world where the vast majority of people are driven by this thing I can't understand is really",

            "Apparently an unpopular opinion: Crazy Rich Asians is completely overrated. I didn't like the book and had some hopes that the movie would be less irritating but nah. It's a terrible representation of Chinese culture and as someone who is Chinese I was hoping for a better representation than that. Like almost anything else would have been better. I would have even preferred another Mulan sequel since at least she's more down-to-earth. I'm especially bothered about how it is acclaimed as \"Asian representation\" when South Asians, West Asians, and Central Asians aren't involved at all and all the characters have \"rich people problems\" few can relate to. Some of my Chinese friends keep gushing over this trash while I'm just sorry I spent money to see this movie."

I feel like everyone always says that you need to maintain your friendships during a relationship, but Im not sure I see losing them as a negative thing. I am worried though that if we break up, I'll be left with no one for support :(."

I have been seeing a therapist, taking meds, meditating, blah blah, but nothing is helping. Everytime I'm left alone for more than half a day or I feel like I'm being sidelined in a group, I rapidly fall into a depressive spiral to the point of suicidal ideation. As soon as I'm around people who genuinely care about me, though, all of these thoughts and feelings just evaporate. I've somehow managed to survive this far by desperately trying to surround myself with caring people, but sometimes they're not around, and I just lack the charm or overall \"\"interestingness\"\" to get close to many people. I don't know what to do. I can't tell my therapist because I'm certain I'll get involuntarily hospitalized, and that won't really solve anything.",

My ex partner would literally go around telling people how much she liked dating a freshman because \u201che\u2019s so easy to control\u201d We were wanting to go into the same industry for work, So my friendships depended on her, my networking depended on her, my access to social scenes around campus depended on her, everything did. Imagine the environment that creates, that your \u201cpartner\u201d can do whatever the hell they want to you, because if you leave, you lose everything connected to MIT around you, because that person had their hands in every part of their life for the sole fact that they\u2019ve been here longer than you have."

The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\u201d",

            "Sorry, but the AI singularity is not really something we need to be worrying about. All of you \u2018(in)effective altruists\u2019 who follow the cult of the singularity are delusional tech bros who have never known a real problem in your whole lives. I bet those trust funds your daddies gave you have been paying for your little excursions to fancy AI conferences. Guess what? There are real people in this country suffering from poverty, homelessness, disease, and despair, and all you can think about is whether computers will someday become so intelligent that they are able to take over your jobs as investment bankers and Silicon Valley executives and leave you with nothing. I think that deep down you know that you\u2019re just like that homeless army vet you ignore every day on the street in San Francisco while you wait for an Uber to take you to your cushy tech job, and you hate yourself for that. I hope the singularity does come and that the robots make you their Grubhub delivery driver slaves. That would be more than you deserve."

            "I feel more disadvantaged in academia because of skin color than I ever thought I would be. I'm black, and 100% of my white mentors (3 so far) have become condescending when meeting me in person AFTER knowing I'm completely reasonable, well-spoken, and intelligent through e-mail. They've all insulted my intelligence even when we have discussions where I correct them, sometimes on very obvious mistakes. In contrast, I've had two asian mentors who never did such a thing. It's so fucking petty - I can't believe I can't just have an objective discussion with fucking scientists. It fills me with seething rage that something as inconsequential as skin color plays such a factor in getting the job of my dreams, and I can never bring it up, otherwise I'M the one that brings race into it. I lost a fucking publication because a mentor's such an asshole.",

Be sure to make your intentions clear, but there is no rush. This is about having fun and forming rewarding relationships, it's not a race.",
            "C) Start a friendship with her. Be sure it is entirely platonic. Let this go on for months, or even years. Never let her know how you feel, but continue to cultivate this friendship until you are at the point that you are calling each other 'best friends'. Again, it's important to never tell her how you feel until you've spend a lot of time building and forming a completely different type of relationship than the one you are actually interested in. Then, when you feel the time has finally come tell her that you aren't actually interested in friendship, you wanted a romantic relationship this entire time. When she isn't comfortable with this, tell her you can't be friends with her anymore because you like and care for her a lot."

            "If someone wants to engage in one of these, it probably benefits them more than it harms anyone else. If a bystander doesn't like any of these, they can just look away. Someone's consent is necessary in situations where the action could potentially harm that someone as much or more as others have to gain from it. So, I think that the above list of activities should be legal for the same reason as we have freedom of speech/religion, the right to wear whatever clothes you want etc. Even if someone is annoyed or disturbed by your views/religion/clothing/public defecation, satisfying your preference to act in that way is more important than others' annoyance (in these cases)."

However, it is super annoying when they are allowed into a class like 11.011, which is extremely over-subscribed and many actual MIT students don't get to take. Then, they are directly taking away the opportunity to take a class from an MIT student who actually pays a very large sum to take classes here. Unless every MIT who wants to take a class is allowed in, no wellesley or harvard students should be."

That seems pretty dumb to do since gender is a social construct, we don't make these distinctions for other social constructs like race, etc. that have similarly large effects on how society treats you. But then, it's also true that most people accept that being LGBT+ isn't a choice. Can't this be used to argue against (1)? Isn't there a contradiction to claiming that sexuality re: attraction to particular genders is rigid, but nothing else is?",

            "Here are some observations/opinions from my life: it seems that gender identity is largely social and mostly a choice, but it\u2019s heavily motivated by gender dysphoria, an innate and immutable psychological condition. Almost every trans person \"\"chooses\"\" to change name/pronouns, but nobody chooses to feel an intense discomfort towards their primary and secondary sex characteristics or towards their treatment within society as a particular gender. I wasn\u2019t born my preferred gender, I was born with a condition eventually resulting in strong distress with my sex and gender. This point of view doesn\u2019t seem too uncommon, but it\u2019s not pushed externally, probably because bigots w/o nuance can easily take it as an admission that trans people are just ~mentally ill~. Even if it isn\u2019t universally agreed upon, the point of view that gender is an essential characteristic to a person is politically attractive, which is why I\u2019d guess it\u2019s pushed so much.",
            "On the rest of your post: when has anybody suggested that being trans automatically changes your sex? Medical transition can change one\u2019s sex to a reasonable degree (obviously, via changes to hormones and several sexual characteristics), but I don\u2019t think any reasonable activists have suggested that a change to one\u2019s gender always implies a change to one\u2019s sex.",
            "Honestly, I see all of the inane comparisons to trans-*ism as equivocation between identities which fly in the face of an obvious biological reality (granting for the sake of discussion that race is an obvious biological reality) and identities which don\u2019t really say anything about biology. Imo it all boils down to the assertions that gender and sex are different, that gender bends by almost definition to one\u2019s feelings, and that sex can be partially changed via methods already common for trans people."

            "For the love of christ, if you don\u2019t like trans women, no one is forcing you to sleep with them. Unless you\u2019re posting bc you want people to challenge your view, this whole conversation seems unproductive and bad to have over the internet. Please stop. There are plenty of people who would not sleep with me, as a tall girl, and if I had to wade through a fuck ton of confessions about that, it would be really hurtful to me. You don\u2019t go around saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sleep with you\u201d to people! Try it, folks, see how far it gets you! You wouldn\u2019t say to Carrie (for example because she has been commenting, and also because she is a freshman girl and it is upsetting for me to see such a young woman feel attacked like this in a public forum) \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sleep with you,\u201d even if you wouldn\u2019t, BECAUSE SHE ALSO PROBABLY DOESN\u2019T WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU (like most women don\u2019t if you have an attitude like that, tbh), AND IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT MATTER ABOUT US WOMEN OTHER THAN OUR FUCKABILITY. And also, if she were interested in you, you would be damn lucky, she\u2019s a delightful girl. But even if she were not, she and others like her do not deserve this treatment on confessions. Maybe just don\u2019t spew hate. Like there are groups that I am prejudiced against but I don\u2019t go around advertising it and I try not to let it affect my interactions with them. How hard is that? Also, bonus round: why do you think it is that we police trans WOMEN on their sexual desirability... oh look, misogyny, my old friend, come to tell women we only are valuable insofar as we turn people on! Turns out our trans sisters reveal a special strain of the hate directed against women more generally! Yay winning. Ugh."

            "Unpopular opinion: Roe v Wade is a garbage SCOTUS decision. The deciding factor was that restricting or banning access to abortion is a violation of an implied right to privacy given by the Fourteenth Amendment. But the Fourteenth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Declaration of Independence explicitly argue that everyone has a right to life. I prefer that these documents be interpreted according to their text and the intentions of the people who wrote them at the time. I can guarantee that none of the Founding Fathers thought that abortion was even remotely okay. Call me a textualist and an originalist (or a strict constructionist if that term's still used), but the idea of the courts stretching these documents beyond their words and intent is scary to me. It basically gives the Supreme Court a legislative power even though the Supreme Court is part of the judicial branch and not the legislative branch. (I have the same problem with executive orders FWIW).",
            "If you want to argue that it's applicable in cases of rape or incest (which comprise a very small minority of abortions in America), fine. But I consider a developing baby in the womb to be a person, no matter what stage of development they're in. Let's focus on the overwhelming majority of abortions, where a woman had consensual sex. Ladies, if you're going to have sex (especially unprotected), you should be old enough and mature enough to understand the risks and to handle getting pregnant and giving birth if it happens. You don't get to kill another living being growing inside you just because you made a bad sexual decision or a mistake. It's called taking responsibility for your body.",

            "I'm a rising senior and I'm realizing that tbh I really hate the way I've been interacting with people for the past couple years here. I really like to be helpful and I'm worried that if I can't be useful to others then they won't want me around ever but that has sort of morphed into my consideration for others being constantly taken for granted. I've started to notice that people take advantage of my willingness to help low-key all the time and then turn around and treat me like shit or take credit for my work or both. When I tell people that this makes me uncomfortable then I'm suddenly a massive bitch or a needy credit whore. I just want the time I put into my work and my friendships to mean something but I've come to understand that no one cares about me as a person unless I'm helping them out. I also had a few notable falling-outs with people last year and my core group of friends all decided that they didn't want to hang around me anymore and started leaving me out of everything while still finding ways to rub that in my face or ask me for favors. Let it be said that I never bothered them with my issues and have also been called on in the past to counsel them through their own shit. Last semester I had a couple days where I was done with the people in my living group doing this and was distant (not smiling or waving). Several of my friends got together to talk about how I was a huge fucking problem. At this point I realized that any emotion I express that isn't perfectly happy and smiling is seen as a character defect, that people leaving me out or saying legitimately cruel things is to be expected and any issue I take with that is also a character defect, and the incredible amount of effort I put into making sure the people around me are okay is expected behavior and nothing to be noticed or mentioned ever. I'm really sorry for the long rambling confession and thanks for making it all the way through my shitty paragraph. I know that this isn't like a huge world problem and I'm sorry for bothering people with my relatively minor issues but I just wanted to get this off my chest and I think that's what confessions is for. All in all, I'm willing to take responsibility for things that I've handled poorly or times that I've lashed out or been frustrated but I'm sick and tired that my patience and kindness are both exploited and ignored.",

            "Asian Americans face discrimination everyday, but sometimes I feel like we aren\u2019t even considered minorities? In high school, we spent a day learning about privilege and race but the only \u201craces\u201d that were mentioned was white, black, and Latino. There aren\u2019t any programs to promote Asian participation in stem, computer science, or anything else. We don\u2019t benefit from race-based affirmative action, and I think many people believe that Asians suffer the most from it. I just don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s nothing to right the wrongs against Asian Americans even though we have also been discriminated against and put into concentration camps. There is little to no Asian representation in media or sports and nothing done to change that."

            "Question from a person somewhat in the center. I\u2019ve read some hot takes from some left-leaning news sites that basically say that if you\u2019re a straight person who would never date a trans person, you\u2019re transphobic. I\u2019m a general supporter of the LGBT community, but I always found this take to be pretty ridiculous. Gender identitification is one thing, but saying that a straight man has to be open to being attracted to someone who might still have male genitalia just seems crazy to me. Anyways, my question is: do leftists actually believe this stuff, or is this just the opinion of a few crazy radicals?"

Also as an international I'm not so sure about the credit system in the US but it shouldn't be too hard to get a small loan, like $500-$1000 just to be significantly more comfortable?

I spend over 100% on housing and literally don't have a dime for food. People all over campus are put in similar situations as this by MIT's stingy pay and their ridiculous fees.

Then over time you continue to engage in positive emotional activities with the other person (pursuing your own interests in a social context is a good starter way to do this), strengthening the connection, and at some point, also engage regarding past individual emotional experiences and often, connect via empathy (if you're empathy is not super developed, don't worry, you can learn) which produces more positive feelings associated with you and at this point, you've probably formed a social attachment."

When I first came to MIT, it was the same way, and I really neglected my family relationships and the relationships I valued with friends from home for the first six months or so before I had enough of a handle on my new environment to be able to put energy into those relationships again. Once I get through this adjustment period, I absolutely want to maintain and grow those relationships, I just usually don't make it to other side of that adjustment period over the summer. Tbh, the first few months after I graduate, I probably will be mostly off the grid in most of my relationships, but after I get past those first few months, I'll pop back up and it doesn't mean that I don't value the relationship!"

            "I sincerely believe it is possible to understand race in America, support the reasoning behind affirmative action, and still oppose it in college admissions. I come from an area of the US that is in the 0th percentile of income and education in the US and is also 98% white. Our schools get grants for computers but have nobody to teach students how to use them, so some of my classmates graduate high school and don't know how to even type. Our students stop and pick up roadkill so they have something to eat (I have too), but for some reason African Americans who are richer and have far better resources get a step up because of an \"\"impoverished group\"\" status. Nearly any argument used for affirmative action also applies to groups of white Americans in the Ohio Valley, central Appalachians, and other places that have been impoverished for generations.",

Surely, that\u2019s not a satisfactory reason. Amount of time something takes isn\u2019t a explanation for doing it in the first place, and there are many more followers on the page so that begs the question why only these few people.",
            "2. Majority (>90%) of the subjects\u2019 comments are extremely left/liberal leaning.",

            "This is why you see the subjects often trying to out-smart, out-intellect, out-wit, out-moral other posts on confession. A tinge of virtue-signaling completes the recipe for likes and heart reacts. Reciprocity is also included (known as circle-jerking in common parlance). This relates to point 2 since in the college climate of social media, liberal values are already accepted and rewarded, thus incentivizing the types of comments we see.",
            "Of course much of this behavior is sub-consciously assimilated, and therefore the subjects display a lack of self-awareness for their behavioral-pattern (see point 1).",

            "According to Confucius, being filial to our parents is the utmost expression of respect. This is an essential element in obtaining the title of chun-tzu, or noble person. However, filial piety is not a one-way street. Parents must also be filial to their children and to their parents. Both parent and child have a natural position and responsibility within the family; therefore natural filial piety is reciprocal. It is through recognizing and practicing filial piety in the family that a person will know how to act outside of the family. For in the Confucian tradition, it is realized that filial piety also exists between all beings. This is evident in the Confucian Golden Rule, which is sometimes referred to as the Silver Rule: \"Do not do unto others what you would want them to not do unto you."

            "@563 I do not necessarily think it is healthy for your mental health to constantly have detailed scenes of you committing/attempting suicide. When I was younger and my parents fought constantly, I used to have those images as well and I would often cry myself to sleep because I knew I don't have the guts in me to do anything close to what I was imaging. It was comforting, for sure - at least take my mind off the background noise and the complicated emotions circulating in the house. But, when I later look back on it, it was a clear sign that I was suffering through some sort of anxiety and depression.",
            "I am not saying that you may have anxiety and/or depression, but having vivid images of yourself attempting suicide is not great to your state of mind. When life hits me in the face, after dwelling in negative emotions, I force myself to look realistically at my situation and what I can do to get myself back on my feet. If I can't see anything at first, I keep on thinking and thinking and do something (who knows pick up a book to read, watch tv shows, go outside and treat myself to some Starbucks drink, etc) so that I can get things moving. I believe that I can move away from the negative space that I found myself in by doing simple things that will get me moving even when I can't see the way out."

            "I swear, nothing annoys me more than when people act like pro-life people are trying to \"\"control women's bodies\"\". Literally nobody thinks that. No pro-life proponent is trying to control my body. That's such an unbelievably fringe opinion. It's one of the most hilariously obvious straw man arguments I've ever seen (second only to some of Trump's arguments). It's an indication of how little the left actually thinks about opposing arguments. Acting like the abortion issue has something to do with \"\"women's rights\"\" is so far removed from the crux of the argument, that it just shrouds their whole side in illegitimacy. The entire damn argument is nothing more than \"\"do fetuses have moral value, and thus cannot be killed because that'd be murder; or do they not have moral value, and thus can be killed at any time; or perhaps a grey area where they're have some moral value, more than zero but less than a living human, and so can be killed under certain sets of circumstances.\"\" Women's rights are not a part of that discussion, except perhaps in the last case (which isn't the pro-life case, of course). If you're pro-life, you're pro life because you think it's immoral to kill unborn babies, not because of some weird ass idea that you want to control women.",
            "This idea that pro-life people are trying to control women's bodies is not only preposterous and ignorant, but it's just plain fucking insulting. I'm certainly a feminist, and I demand full control over my own body, but I'm still pro-life because I believe that a baby inside of me is NOT \"\"my body\"\". It's the baby's body which happens to be inside me. I don't get to just go murdering it because I don't want it to be alive anymore, regardless of my reason for wanting it gone.",
            "By all means, there certainly are very reasonable arguments for abortion that I do find compelling (like abortion after a rape, I'll admit that one makes me feel very conflicted about my position), but you hurling insulting straw man arguments at me to belittle the validity of my opinion is not the way to go, people.",
            "P.S. also annoying is when people accuse me of being brainwashed or manipulated because I'm a female pro-life supporter. I'm a grown woman, I can make my own fucking opinions. You call yourself a feminist, but imply that my opinions must not be my own just because I'm a woman? Fuck you.\""

There's no reason to call corporal punishment or an expression of negative emotion physical or emotional abuse just because it's different from Western-style parenting. In most countries around the world physcial punishment and shouting is used to discipline children and only a small number of European countries have outlawed it. Describing it as abuse is just another form of Western-centrism."

            "tl;dr: @men, invest in your sexual desirability as much as the average woman does, and you will attract sexual partners nearly as easily as the average woman.",
            "@472 I do understand why it would seem like it is much harder for a man to attract female sexual partners, because the average heterosexual man does probably attract far fewer sexual partners than the average heterosexual woman. But what most men don't seem to understand is that the reason it's much easier for the average woman to attract a man is because the average woman puts soooooo much more time, energy, and money into being sexually desirable than the average man does.",
            "If you're a man going \"\"poor me, it's not fair, it's so easy for women to have sex,\"\" ask yourself when was the last time you plucked your eyebrows? Waxed something, if your appearance would benefit from that (which for most people, it would)? Have you figured out exactly what clothes are flattering to your body and do you almost exclusively wear those? Have you figured out the most flattering haircut and styling for you? What about your facial hair? What's your skincare routine like? (And washing your face and mayyybe using moisturizing does not a skincare routine make.)",
            "The average woman has done all these things (well, except facial hair styling) and much, much more. If you want to attract sexual partners with the ease of the average woman, then invest as much in your sexual desirability as the average woman. If you do this, you will probably have an even larger selection of partners than the average woman, because men who bother to do this are so scarce.",
            "So yeah, it may seem like it's easier for women to attract sexual partners (and this would probably still be slightly true regardless, because slut shaming means fewer women are down for casual sex, and men are less likely to be worried that a hookup is going to murder them), but mostly I think it's just that women as a population invest so much more in their sexual desirability than men (and yes, that is including forms of investing in one's sexual desirability other than physical appearance, but that's a whole different rant)."

            "#477 All this posting about whether or not Asian Americans get their exceptionally higher test scores because of higher average wealth or cultural differences or first generation mentality or parental pressure is missing the entire point of the debate. Colleges are actively discriminating against them for seemingly no reason other than to admit other students of different races to promote diversity. Which is not a bad thing in and of itself. It does however become malicious when admitting students purely because of their race or gender or some other immutable characteristic. Instead, they should promote diversity of thought not diversity of skin color. Just my 2 cents. Have at it in the comments. - signed a cishet white male."

            "I'm curious about how much people usually spend on food each week and how much is considered a lot/starving. I've been comfortably eating on $20 a week for some time now, $25 if you count transportation (and plus some small things like olive oil and a bag of rice that I bought at the start of the year). I was worse off in the fall and spent around $10-$15 per week but I was by no means starving, although I did take advantage of consistent free food sources on campus (fruit, ramen, coffee) if I ran out of food. Some people react to this like it's a tiny amount but I'm still quite healthy and keeping a consistent weight. What's a lot or a little? I'm interested in some context."

            "There's this guy I have a crush on. He's a rising junior, and I'm a rising sophomore. We do Model UN together, and I met him at the first MUN social. It was a barbecue at a MUN upperclassman's house, and my crush was playing cornholes on the lawn. I remember the moment he introduced himself- I was immediately in awe. His looks, his personality, his background and interests...everything was so perfect. Months later, we're at a MUN conference together. We're sitting on the side of a long table together during a team dinner. His friends were making fun of him for how he tries to pick up girls with literature...the irony is that I would love that kind of thing. Then he mentions a confessions post I made a while back about him- he memorized every word. He said he wondered who it was, and had genuinely no idea it was me. If only I could say something. It would be so weird if I asked him out after all of this time, right? I'm not even on his radar I'm sure...we don't have the same friends and the only time we see each other is MUN (that is a lot of time, but still). Or should I just forget it and stick to my own class/year? Ugh"

I clarified in all cases that these were idle fantasies, day dreams that I wish I could enact, but not things I actually had any conviction to do at this point. I clarified that I had none of the means for most of these (no knowledge of access to green building roof, no alcohol at the time but that\u2019s a low barrier, and no experience with setting a regulator or proper mask for gas asphyxiation). I did mention that I had two box cutters on my room, but prefaced that this was a method of last resort as it might be easy to stop midway through and attempt to save myself once the pain began given my lack of experience with self harm. I was asked to throw away the box cutters. They asked at the next meeting if I had, which I hadn\u2019t, and never asked again. I clarified that I only did superficial research into the subjects.",

We were in a sexually active relationship, and we had agree to have sexual relationships while being drunk before. She indeed wanted to stop it after that night, and that was the end of our relationship.

I'm quite excited for it and I think that I'll learn a lot, but without any other experience, will I be competitive for internships next year? Is there also any signaling benefit of doing well in a UROP rather than doing a mediocre job, for short-term professional purposes (i.e. not for grad school rec letters)? Of course I'll try my best either way (since learning from it is the most important part) but just wondering what should my priorities be if I want to actually be able to live comfortably next summer."

            "I want to make bring up a point in good faith but I don't want to sound like I'm changing the subject here so please hear me out? We direly need to fix the issue with sexual assault and rape. But I feel like almost importantly, we need to fix our alcohol and drinking culture. It's not just the DT study breaks because I've seen other student group parties/mixers and frat parties be just as crazy. And as the night progresses, things gets really uncomfortable. Some people get really aggressive with alcohol and other people become unable to care for themselves. Everyone, if you see a brother or a male friend become drunk and really pushy to a girl who isn't having it, get him away from her (suck up your ego and take the \"cockblocking\" comment later). Also, if you see a female friend who may have had too much to drink, stay with her and ask her if she is okay with any decision she is making and if she seem incapacitated of making decisions, take her home. Either way, control your drinking and if a friend is pushing you to get drunk and won't let you get away with it, that's the friends fault, not yours. Controlling alcohol use will not fix the sexual assault problem nor will it stop offenders, but it can help potentially prevent one. Please watch how much you drink and stand up for someone who has had too much to drink. Even if this wasn't the case with this past incident, I feel like it's important. Sorry for sounding like someone from AlcoholEDU or MADD."

            "Drunk people can't consent and here's why:",
            "Person A is drunk and Person B is not. A agrees to do sexual activities with B. In the morning A \"regrets\" the sexual act. In this case they were TOO INTOXICATED TO PROPERLY MAKE A DECISION. We all know alcohol impairs inhibitory control. So A appeared to give consent to an act that, while sober, they would not have. At the very best A has had a shitty night with B. More likely B has taken advantage of A because B was able to make a clear and informed decision while A was not. And B is well aware of the fact that alcohol made A more likely to sleep with them because we all went through freshman orientation so if B didn't know before college they damn well do now. Both of these options suck. You don't want to be in either of these situations regardless of whether you are A or B. And if you are B you are responsible for A's assault because you (consciously or not) used a drug to make A more likely to let you sleep with them.",
            "No one should have to worry about being taken advantage of sexually when drunk just like no one should have to worry about people coming up to them and asking them to sign contracts selling their soul away while drunk. Both of these situations are absurd and you shouldn't have to control how much you drink in order to avoid getting taken advantage of.",
            "Some people here have argued that it's impossible to expect that no one will commit crimes because there will always be robbers and murderers etc. And while this is true, THE VAST MAJORITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS are perpetrated by people known to the survivor. And plenty of sexual assaults could be prevented if EVERYONE had an extremely clear understanding of what consent means. At MIT it looks like this: https://studentlife.mit.edu/vpr/all-about-consent"

            "MIT Timely Confessions and MIT confessions this past month has helped undue a lot of good faith attempts by a lot of people here at MIT who are trying to address the mental health issue (Peer Ears, GRTs, S3, etc.). Whoever has been ranting about involuntary hospitalization has damaged people's perception of MIT Mental Health (probably the goal of that person or few people...). If we're going to talk about filtering MIT confession posts, I think we really need to minimize whoever is going on about hating the administration for involuntary hospitalization. I'm upset by this because those in Peer Ears and other student-led groups work so hard and it just takes one person with a bad experience to bring all that work down...talk about selfishness..."

            "I personally am in favor of MIT / other colleges NOT being held liable for mental health, and am happy about the court outcome. Most negative effects for students come out of MIT's need to protect itself because of lingering In Loco Parentis BS. I wish students (and parents) would stop holding them accountable for things like self harm, suicide, and mental health unless there is a strong reason to suggest intentional abuse because I think it makes MIT less likely to react with compassion and more likely to cover their ass against law suits that have been made in the past (and imo shouldn't have been made).

            "Giving advice on how to change possible sexual assault situations (more specifically looking at the \"How can we change this?\" bullets of post #7080) is great, and I think it's super important that people learn how to avoid/prevent dangerous situations. That being said, I have noticed a huge bias towards the assumption that the man is always the rapist, and the woman is always the survivor. I know that this is certainly the more common trend of sexual assaults, but I think that there is a blatant disregard for the fact that it happens the other way as well. I was raped (not during my time at MIT - it was before I came here), and have felt very uneasy about how the conversations around sexual assault go. I'm struggling for the right words to describe it, but perhaps it's a lack of validation? The advice always suggests that the man is always the rapist in the assault, and even though I know it's important for the advice to be out there, it makes my past feel unimportant, and unacknowledged. I know this feeling stemmed from the fact that my own parents didn't believe me, but by fucking definition, what happened to me was rape. I said no, multiple times, and was overpowered. For some shitty reason, nobody every believed that I said no, or didn't want it. Apparently guys only want sex so clearly I wanted it. And the culture of my shitty home is appearing here, where everyone seems to think the only females need to give consent or only females can say no and mean it, that guys only want to fucking have sex. And I'm not trying to invalidate the argument from a female's perspective! Just fuck this society, fuck this culture of rape, fuck the fact that some people don't understand the word \"no\"."

People writing strong opinions about MIT mental health (perhaps because they have a vendetta against them of a bad experience) and posting it as if it's facts. Post #7207 is a good example of where perpetuates misinformation by one person. Look mental health is complex issue and there is no one right way to fix it. It's hard to believe since we're all engineers and feel like things should be deterministic, but if we had already figured out the right way to tackle this issue, there would probably be a company making money off of it, but there isn't. As such, one person's experience with MIT Mental Health is NOT generalizable so please STOP saying it is. You can share your experience in a constructive manner but being super opinionated doesn't help anyone, especially the person who is suicidal. If anything, it can cause that person to take the wrong action and experience serious consequence. When it comes to helping other people with mental health issues, swallow your own ego and think about the other person, not what you went through."

            "Protecting yourself is still the best way to prevent crime. Doesn't matter what crime it is, whether it's rape, theft, mugging, even car accidents sometimes.",
            "Just telling criminals to stop being criminals is wishful thinking. I mean yeah it'd be nice if we could just say \"Swiper no swiping\" and then all the murderers and rapists and kidnappers would just say \"aw man\" and become civil members of society. Problem is that's just not how the world works. If you're a worthless piece of shit who kills innocent people, you'll probably always be a worthless piece of shit and nobody will be able to change that. If you're so fundamentally fucked up in the head that you think it's okay to rape someone, then just being told otherwise won't make you stop. Criminals will always be criminals. Telling rapists to just stop raping is no more effective than just telling terrorists to stop setting off bombs.",
            "Crime is inevitable, so you should just do what you can to protect yourself. If you don't want your car to get stolen, you lock the doors and take the keys with you. If you don't want your house to be robbed, you lock the doors and get a security system.",
            "A great example is a 4-way intersection with a traffic light. If you're stopped at the red light, then it turns green and you go, but someone runs their red light and hits you. OBVIOUSLY it's their fault that the accident happened, but just saying \"oh it's their fault\" doesn't do any good if you're already dead. That's why you never drive through a green light without checking to make sure that nobody is about to run the red light. It's just common sense. Everybody agrees that you shouldn't just drive through a green light without checking first, but as soon as you say you shouldn't intentionally put yourself in vulnerable positions to be raped, everybody loses their mind.",
            "Self-protection isn't specific to rape, everybody (men and women) do it in every aspect of their lives. I'm a man, and I still carry a knife if I'm out at night. When I'm back home where it's legal, I carry a gun everywhere I go. I don't walk around at night alone, I lock the door to my car and house, and I don't get myself so drunk that literally anyone could take advantage of me. Obviously rapists are at fault for rape, but that doesn't make it rational to go out of your way to make yourself the easiest possible target."

            "Why I'm unfollowing all MIT confession pages:",
            "- because I can already predict the condescending and shortsighted comments by the SAME PEOPLE every time (you know who you are)",
            "- because I consider myself a liberal 100% and make no mistake, I detest the recent events that have happened at MIT, but I also cannot stand the tone of the dialogue around them",
            "- because when perfectly decent people post anonymous thoughts that question principles that ultra-leftists take for granted, most comments will be from liberals who, rather than respond to the OP's points and actually answer their questions, will comment with such superiority and hubris that it further isolates people with views and questions similar to those of the OP, acting to further divide the student body rather than bring it together",
            "- because the dialogue I see on these pages is stemming from the exact place that caused Trump to be elected; extremism exists on both sides, and when extremists don't stop to actually listen to the people in the middle, it pushes them in the opposite direction.",
            "I would really caution all extreme leftists to think more about *how* you respond to left/moderate concerns (on social media and in real life). Right now, the world needs more human compassion, and I am not seeing any at all on these confession pages. When an extreme liberal responds in an isolating manner to a more moderate liberal, it's usually just going to push them farther away from wanting to support the \"liberal agenda.\" (Some examples that I think are less black-and-white than liberals give them credit for: victim-blaming/safety precautions, trigger warnings, etc.) If you want to make a point, it is so much more effective to point out the validity in the other person's argument and then explain why it's not quite right, or to validate one part of an argument before disproving another part of it.",
            "I really hope my MIT community can find a better way to have these important discussions, and can at least try to put themselves in the shoes of others before they respond to confessions in such a harsh manner. Maybe then we can start to see eye-to-eye."

            "If a woman states an utter lie or falsehood about a man, that man's character will be forever considered in question, even if he is innocent. This is something that happened to me. A woman once accused me of stalking her even though I saw her so infrequently that it was literally only in class, and nowhere else. I'm someone with social anxiety, have never even flirted with anyone far less followed them around, have had silent crushes with painful outcomes, and now am afraid of walking outside, riding the bus, going to class, meeting with friends, and heaven forbid going anywhere near where she might be present (including events hosted by groups that she might be in, even though I'm interested for a totally different reason).",
            "It is not sufficient to just say \"if someone is not a perpetrator, the investigation will reveal him not to be so.\" Sometimes there is no investigation. There wasn't with me. It was just slander. She didn't need me to be arrested or investigated, because she wasn't actually afraid of me and I hadn't actually done anything wrong. She used the rightful goodwill of society in believing her story (we should consider all abuse threats as credible, etc.) to her own advantage, destroying my confidence in the process. Many of you will comment on here saying that I'm a liar, and that is my point. Every woman must have her story treated as credible, and should have it investigated and resolved, both legally and in the eyes of the public. Every woman does not, however, have the right to ruin any man she chooses simply by telling a lie about him.",
            "I am 120% with the feminist movement, and I consider myself one, because I believe that what happened with me is rare and not the common trend in our society - most of the time, the woman is afraid to speak out even when she has been abused. I even advocate that the woman who spoke about me formally do so and make her case, so that a proper investigation be had (one that I'm not afraid of, since I did nothing wrong). But it is not ok to hide behind the guise of feminism to hurt other people."

            "Drinking in large groups is both a nuisance and a well established risky behavior. There\u2019s little point in making the distinction that rape requires a perpetrator: obviously. If you\u2019re aware that an activity has a well established risk (regardless if random, naturally occurring, or by way of bad actors), perhaps you should avoid it. Screaming \u201crape apologist\u201d at every criticism isn\u2019t constructive. More people could be saved by avoiding risky behavior; that much is undeniable. Maybe we should be questioning the culture of large student groups organizing private parties.

            "Although I agree that the idea of a fraternity is extremely archaic and the sooner we move on from having living groups that can only recruit a single gender the better, why do people think that removing frats from campus would naturally reduce the number of rapes and sexual assaults? Fraternities are not really a concept outside of the US and yet in the UK and Australia, for example, as many as 1 in 10 women report being raped while at university. The problem lies much deeper in our global society, and university campuses appear to be one of the more prevalent locations where this occurs. Whether it is dorms, fraternities, or all men's sports teams, I think there is this hot-headed, aggressive attitude that develops within some men when they find themselves among a large groups of guys that compels them to feel that they can take what they want from a woman, whether she agrees or not.",
            "So, what if we just get rid of frats? Well, we would still have all men's sports teams and other groups of men who hang out together, and I feel that it is natural that among these groups, guys will sometimes objectify women when they talk together (\"XXX is so hot, did you see her instagram post yesterday...\" or whatever) and groups of women do the exact same things back to men, and of course men do this to men, women to women, non-binary to non-binary etc etc. However, my fear is that when it is a a group of guys talking about women, in a small number of cases (but nonetheless more cases than when this conversation occurs for women talking about men etc), there will be a man in the group who will allow this momentary objectification to grow into an overall feeling that they can do whatever they want to a woman they find attractive. Sometimes it takes alcohol to bring out these feelings, and sometimes it does not.",
            "I do not think that fraternities are the reason that men fundamentally do this more than any other group. All fraternities must want their members to treat women well and make them feel safe, first and foremost because that is just how people should be anyway, but also because the consequence of that not happening can be seen with TDC right now. (whether it was a TDC member or not who commited the rape, they are seeing the consequence of this reflect extremely negatively on their whole house). It has to be something deeper than that, something fundamentally wrong with our society that means that some men: (1) think that women say no to a guy to \"play hard to get\" and she really does actually want to have sex with him and he has to take charge to initiate sex and/or (2) extend the small levels of objectification that occur between every group from time to time into a deeper feeling that women are just objects for them to have sex with. I really have no idea how we solve that."

Also, it seems like the feminist movement has become less about male/female equality and more about the willingness to destroy the lives of men.

Even if you think fraternities are generally bad organizations, that doesn't justify targeting an individual fraternity, or individuals within it, because of one person's actions. This just takes the blame from being focused on an individual, who is solely responsible, to a blanket across many who are not at fault."

But why the fuck are they receiving death threats and having their house covered in graffiti for something that could have just as easily happened literally anywhere? A major context piece is that seems to be missing for a lot of people is that the rapist wasn't even a brother of the frat, he was just someone at the party who took advantage of a girl. Which could LITERALLY HAPPEN ANYWHERE. I really don't think TDC is the problem, or that frats as a whole are. Shutting them down will accomplish nothing. The only thing that can make a difference here is a change of culture, which requires all of us in the MIT community to support one another. If you see something, say something; and please watch out for your friends and yourself when you go out. Stay safe and spread some love y'all.

Now here\u2019s what I want: I think we all know TDC isn\u2019t the worst example on our campus of this type of thing. I would liberally estimate they\u2019re in 6th. We need to put our stories of bad frats out there, not only so we can weed out the worst apples, but so incoming freshman don\u2019t come in and get swept up by the rush vans of frats that are going to turn them into worse people. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to figure out how to show which frats are worst, as the mods on here wouldn\u2019t want to post that (for understandable reasons. They\u2019ve been roasted for publishing disparaging material before.) But we need to do something. TDC is not the problem, it\u2019s just one of them."

            "A lot of times, a lot of people are afraid to seek help after being a victim of sexual assault because they aren't sure what they want to happen to the perpetrator and they don't want to make a big deal about it. Victims want to get help, but they might feel personally responsible if anything terrible happens to the perpetrator or if a frat gets shut down. The threatening attitudes are not helping anyone. That is possibly why for the past Timely Warnings, the police don't have an ID for the perpetrator, because the victim possibly chose to not share it because he / she needs to do more emotional processing before he / she makes a decision as to how things should proceed legally. Timely Warnings are only made when a perpetrator is not identified to the police. Going to the police for an initial report or a hospital for DNA / STD testing etc. immediately is important for evidence for later for legal reasons, but emotional healing is also more important.",
            "As someone who has been sexually assaulted in the past and have helped a lot of other people who had dealt with similar experiences, the best way to support someone who has been sexually assaulted is to provide emotional support, listening to them, asserting that it is not their fault, and turning them to resources like VPR, BARCC (the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center), S^3, and mental health."

They \"curved\" the first exam upwards so that an A was above a 91/92 instead of a 90. People complained and the instructors said that it wasn't technically curving the test but that the 91 border was just to give people a sense of how well they met the class expectations (A is excelled in learning the concepts, B is good learning, C is adequate, etc). Sure, that's fair. Except now, they won't release our final exam grades (unless we really want to and then we can set up an appointment with the class moderator during the FALL SEMESTER), nor our final percentage, nor what constitutes an A or B or C. Everything is super hidden from the students and kind of sketchy. They usually finish grading exams in a day, but this time they said they'll try to give us our final class grade in a week. Are there any rules that say they have to be more transparent about grade cutoffs and curves and such?"

It's been incredibly difficult, consuming (mentally, emotionally, and physically), and just all around pretty garbage at times. But I have to say I love it at MIT. I've found the most inspirational, kind, and just overall genuine people over the past year. I've made so many friends that I know I can rely on for anything. And most importantly, I think I'm learning that with the help (and pset answers of others) I can accomplish so much more than I thought possible. IHTFP <3"

It's easy to brand everything sexist, racist, or worst of all *gasp* conservative. Who's going to want to argue that they're NOT being sexist (regardless of if they're innocent or not)? That framing is already fucked from the start.",

Heck divisions of tribes slaughter each other because of ancient battles. It will serve you well to realize you're not a special snowflake whose feelings people should tip-toe around. Own your beliefs. Own your feelings. Sure, stand up for what you think. But GOD stop being so ignorant on your moral high ground thinking that your beliefs are higher or more correct than everyone else's."

I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement\u2014 please don\u2019t hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don\u2019t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(",
            "Anyways, on with the question. I\u2019m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don\u2019t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in \u201cfemale\u201d activities such as putting on make up, liking \u201cgirlish\u201d colors, and \u201cspeaking\u201d like a girl? I guess what I\u2019m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?",
            "If this is the case, then why can\u2019t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) \u201chim\u201d a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming \u201ctransgender (in this sense)?\u201d Isn\u2019t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?",
            "TLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain \u201cgender,\u201d even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn\u2019t exist according to the left? Please don\u2019t hate on me :("

And it's not like this is a new problem - the restaurants in the stud have horrible ratings on sites like yelp, google, etc. and have for many years now. It's to the point where I wonder if the people in charge of these decisions have even eaten at the stud or in the dining halls. I challenge administrators to eat at the same places that the students have to for a month and let that experience guide their decisions in the future."

If someone makes you feel uncomfortable and unsafe, no matter WHAT color they are, call the police. Cambridge PD, MIT PD, Boston PD, whoever you can reach quickest. You should really have the emergency number at the top of your contacts list. There are way too many horror stories out there to start making women second guess calling the police when they are in danger."

Is this because Asian people are, on average, smarter, or is it genuinely just because of cultural differences that encourage better study habits. I feel like the latter is just something people say because it would seem 'problematic' to suggest that Asians are inherently smarter. But, honestly, I feel like a lot of cultures, including American and European cultures, also encourage good study habits. I just really doubt that Asian cultures have some magical parenting trick that would tip the scales this much."

I know killing myself isn't the answer, but I don't know what other options there are that I haven't already tried. I don't even really want a future at this point, I just want all the hurt to stop."

Free market ideas underly every aspect of our existence; this very platform is an example of that. Disagreeing with the status quo inherently means disagreeing with a system you live immersed in, and being immersed in a system indeed means many aspects of your way of life depend on it. But should being immersed in a system to the point of depending on it for the things you do in daily life mean you must be loyal to that system, that you are not justified in criticizing it or in feeling that certain aspects of it, even those you depend on and live off of, are in fact wrong?"

            "I think the stigma at MIT to be smart paired with lack of social skills is more present than I originally thought. I am proud that this school offers a lot of social opportunities for its students, but I feel like more people need to take advantage; like its cool to discuss my academic passion, but I kinda wish more people would know hip hop lyrics, skateboarding, prob play some sports and use less jargon. Sure smart is sexy, but its important to be in touch with things outside your major. Overall, I think appreciate of being able to BALANCE social life and academic passions is ever so crucial... more thoughts to come (lmk what topics you guys are interested in)---- signed A.K.S (p1/3)",

My friends from home all are on spring break now or next week, and when we go on it, my rich-ass MIT friends will be off to Europe or Asia and I'll be home alone for the fourth year in a row, with my friends there all back at school. Then when summer rolls around, MIT's late, inflexible finals schedule makes me start my internship so late that I don't get a single week off to celebrate graduation with them before I'm back to MIT to start MEng. I always felt so blessed to have such a close group of friends but I feel like at every turn MIT is forcing me apart from them. Anyone else in this boat?"

I know it's hard when people talk about how easy MIT is, especially when they emphasize how easy freshman year is - but it's all about the background you had coming in. Don't let them bother you. You'll be okay."

I really liked him, but it became too painful to be around him when I knew he was seeing someone else and when I was just a friend to him. At least meeting him showed me that there are good people out there in the world that could potentially be compatible with me and who could treat me well in a friendship or romantic relationship. I miss him though, but it's better to miss him from afar in this case since he's in a relationship, and I still have feelings for him :("

While white people today are not personally responsible for owning slaves, there is a huge difference in the advantages given to the average white person vs. the average black person. The differences around slavery do not fade in a single generation. You seem to be very concerned about fault and blame - it's not your fault that your ancestors hold slaves. However, it is 100% worth talking about people who do and do not get advantages, including those tied to race. You're basically saying \"Shut up, I don't want to hear about what advantages I've gotten because I didn't choose the world to be like this!\" In which case, grow the fuck up, it's not all about you."

I write this specifically cause one of the most amazing, strong, and feminist people I know had to make that decision and chose not to pursue action cause they were afraid of societal and family repercussions, and often beats themselves up about not pursuing some action due to posts like that.

            "Serious question: Do white women, especially southern white women have no self respect for themselves? It seems like they as a collective keep voting in people who are misogynistic sexual predators and women of color end up having to come through to vote for candidates that better represent the interests of women. Like what the fuck? I can understand (but absolutely not agree with) why men would vote for POS humanoid clumps like Donald Trump and Roy Moore, but for women, objectively speaking, there is no benefit to voting these pieces of trash into positions of power. I am glad Roy Moore lost. It's a step in the right direction but that fact that the race was as close as it was is appalling."

            "am a guy from rural America where I was surrounded by millions and millions of white folks. Before coming to Asia, I saw native Asian people only in anime, I especially appreciated characters like Yuki and Nami. I honestly thought that I would easily find a beautiful Asian waifu, that would be tsundere and busty. Honestly, I have never been so disappointed! Most of the girls look like regular people! Sure, they are intelligent and friendly, but absolutely thin! Great majority of them don't even have large chests (I am yet to meet a girl here who uses above a B size bra). The clothes! Ok, I realized that some girls use clothes to disguise awful figures. Seriously, bodies here look like a Red Cross commercial! How on earth can I agree to kiss a girl with no hourglass figure?"

            "These physics exams are perfect examples of why people get so stressed out and concerned for their academic success. If a fundamental sophomore physics course has a 45 test average, how are people expected to display any mastery of the material for an absolutely unrealistically difficult exam? And if you post a distribution the day of the exam where the average is a 45, you better expect that people will be pretty fucking anxious about seeing their grades. When you wait 5 days without any updates on grading, people are going to be pretty spooked and will consider dropping the course. Most of us aren't the pure math kids who took the advanced version of this class in 6th grade and sail by with a 97 average. We're trying to learn physics but are too busy getting dicked on by these horrific exams."

            "I just want to lay down the dating game for guys and girls. Guys, if you like a girl, tell her so you can know early on if there is any chance. Being a wimp and doing nice things expecting to woo her only to find out she doesn't like you is your fault. Could have saved a lot of time and effort if you had the confidence to tell her sooner. Girls, you're not entitled to being treated like a princess. If you date an asshole, you should have seen clear cut signs early on he has no intention of changing for you, but you ignored it. That's on you, not the guy. Bottom line for both scenarios is you cannot force someone to do something they don't want to do. Love is a two way street. If the person doesn't feel the same way, get over it and move on. The longer you remain attached, the worse it gets."

I've been slapped by sixteen freshmen and fourteen non-frosh. In general, I've had terrible experiences with all of the girls. The top five girls I've asked out have come from SK, \u03a0\u0392\u03a6, AX\u03a9, KA\u0398 and A\u03a6. The most disappointing girls have been from KA\u0398, A\u03a6 and \u03a0\u0392\u03a6. I've crawled back to only three girls multiple times coz they were so savage. The hottest girl was from SK whilst the sassiest was from \u0394\u03a6\u0395. I look forward to completing my quest, this IAP."

Plus a lot of international course 6's are sellouts from course 18 who realize they have no future in math since they are poorly prepared for the rigor, when compared to the non-international course 18's."

Most of my friends from high school are going to community colleges or state schools and I would argue they're more intelligent and aware than some of the hard-headed students at elite colleges are. They're majoring in astrophysics, engineering, etc. One of my friends reads multiple books in a day and another has learning disabilities but is majoring in nursing with straight A's. We seem to think we're better than those who go to state schools and community colleges because we're at MIT or whatever private university in the surrounding area.

We still crack the same old jokes at each other and have a good time overall, but I find myself wanting to avoid talking about my new comfortable lifestyle, as many of them have struggled to find a job that they enjoy or relates to their major or doesn't exhaust them. I understand that this is the reality for most people and I appreciate the opportunities I've been given in this lifetime so far, but it hurts to see my old friends struggling to get by with jobs that they hate and/or wear them out mainly because of the different opportunities that were presented to us at the relatively young age of 17-18."

            "@#10222 Dude, think about it, you literally don't even know her. You don't know if she is the cuddling type etc. You just have oneitis. That's not to say that you might not be a good match, but stop projecting your idealized traits onto her and making her out to be some perfect person in your mind because the fact is she isn't. You putting her on a pedestal is only going to fuck up any chances you have because you're going to be clingy and needy and seeking validation from her, and idk her so I can't say whether or not she will like the attention at first but she definitely will not truly care for it in the long run. Realize that she's just another human being, and talk to her. Find out who she really is, and if you love that person then go for it, but realize that the girl in your head is not the girl that exists in real life."

I knew another friend at my dorm who slept her best friend's ex. When her best friend confronted her about it, she got mad!

I hope everyone, including the BSU, realize that asking any handful of black people how they feel about a topic is not inherently representative of the opinions of black people as a whole, and that it is important to try to convey the diversity of black opinion (e.g. many blacks are fine with the idea of non-blacks wearing dreads)"

Of course I am happy for them and I cheer them on but I just want to feel some of that happiness/success for myself as well. I cheer on these people all the time but never have anyone do the same for me even once. And it's not that I cheer others on because I expect the same in return, but because I really do believe in them. I guess people don't bother with me because I cheer on others so much that they think I cheer on myself? I've gotten to the point where I am unfollowing people on social media and avoiding them in real life to stop being constantly reminded of how inadequate and useless I am. I literally spend every waking moment of the day studying and working and still just barely getting by.

            "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Robert A. Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Weinberg\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they\u2019re not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cIn contradistinction,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02",

I'm now doing well academically for the first time at MIT, but I've seen a clear pattern where I only do well when I shut people out and act selfish. I've always prided myself on being there for my friends though, and as someone who also struggles with mental health, I really want to be there for my friends who struggle with theirs. But I'm realizing it's just not sustainable or practical. I'm only taking 4 classes and I've become minimally involved in extracurriculars, yet I still feel like I constantly have to work and study to get the grades I want. I'm becoming like the people here who prioritize school over friends, people I always used to resent and complain about. Makes me feel hypocritical. IHTFP. Seems like you can't \"succeed\" without being selfish and a low-key shitty friend. What's the point of all this high-achieving bullshit when we can't even be there for each other."

Ok, you don\u2019t need straight A\u2019s or even straight B\u2019s to survive. Hell, you don\u2019t even need to go to college. But know that employers will judge the hell outta you if you have a shit GPA and mediocre resume. Why the hell would classes be graded if GPA didn\u2019t matter. 2. \u201cAt MIT, we have the November Rule\u201d - lolwut. Only tourists believe this shit. 3. \u201cBroo party cuz its PNR\u201d \u2013 have fun while you can and get C\u2019s in classes that you give no fucks about.
