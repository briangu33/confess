["#7298 I need your help:\nThere's this guy I have a crush on. He's a rising junior, and I'm a rising sophomore. We do Model UN together, and I met him at the first MUN social. It was a barbecue at a MUN upperclassman's house, and my crush was playing cornholes on the lawn. I remember the moment he introduced himself- I was immediately in awe. His looks, his personality, his background and interests...everything was so perfect. Months later, we're at a MUN conference together. We're sitting on the side of a long table together during a team dinner. His friends were making fun of him for how he tries to pick up girls with literature...the irony is that I would love that kind of thing. Then he mentions a confessions post I made a while back about him- he memorized every word. He said he wondered who it was, and had genuinely no idea it was me. If only I could say something. It would be so weird if I asked him out after all of this time, right? I'm not even on his radar I'm sure...we don't have the same friends and the only time we see each other is MUN (that is a lot of time, but still). Or should I just forget it and stick to my own class/year? Ugh"]

I had a 5.0 gpa for a few years, I really enjoyed learning, research... and then I had an emotionally abusive relationship with a grad student who ended up having severe psychological problems. I was in pure panic mode for months while trying to help and understand him, and after I just became depressed and traumatized. I don’t even feel like the same person anymore. I don’t like to be anywhere near campus or even in Cambridge... Sometimes I feel sick just walking down the hallway or mass ave. I have one more year here, and I am scared I’m not finishing well. It’s like everything I did before is wasted because now I’m traumatized and burnt out, so I barely have energy to finish well and apply for what I’m capable of.

No one can address the issue or bring people to justice if you're making legitimate claims on a shitposting facebook page.

I can probably be identified by the following description but whatever.', 'I have at various times described specific plans to both my therapist and psychiatrist and was not committed. I told them that I fantasized of jumping off the green building; poisoning myself with alcohol while locked in my room with the door blocked off; cutting my carotid artery with a box cutter after gagging myself to muffle the screams; and stealing a dewer or LN2 from around campus, hiding deep in the tunnels, and asphyxiating myself. I clarified in all cases that these were idle fantasies, day dreams that I wish I could enact, but not things I actually had any conviction to do at this point. I clarified that I had none of the means for most of these (no knowledge of access to green building roof, no alcohol at the time but that’s a low barrier, and no experience with setting a regulator or proper mask for gas asphyxiation). I did mention that I had two box cutters on my room, but prefaced that this was a method of last resort as it might be easy to stop midway through and attempt to save myself once the pain began given my lack of experience with self harm. I was asked to throw away the box cutters. They asked at the next meeting if I had, which I hadn’t, and never asked again. I clarified that I only did superficial research into the subjects.', 'I suppose in my case it was important to stress these were idle daydreams and that I lacked the conviction to make an attempt.

We were in a sexually active relationship, and we had agree to have sexual relationships while being drunk before.

We direly need to fix the issue with sexual assault and rape. But I feel like almost importantly, we need to fix our alcohol and drinking culture. It\'s not just the DT study breaks because I\'ve seen other student group parties/mixers and frat parties be just as crazy. And as the night progresses, things gets really uncomfortable. Some people get really aggressive with alcohol and other people become unable to care for themselves. Everyone, if you see a brother or a male friend become drunk and really pushy to a girl who isn\'t having it, get him away from her (suck up your ego and take the "cockblocking" comment later). Also, if you see a female friend who may have had too much to drink, stay with her and ask her if she is okay with any decision she is making and if she seem incapacitated of making decisions, take her home. Either way, control your drinking and if a friend is pushing you to get drunk and won\'t let you get away with it, that\'s the friends fault, not yours. Controlling alcohol use will not fix the sexual assault problem nor will it stop offenders, but it can help potentially prevent one. Please watch how much you drink and stand up for someone who has had too much to drink. Even if this wasn\'t the case with this past incident, I feel like it\'s important. Sorry for sounding like someone from AlcoholEDU or MADD.']

["#7270 Drunk people can't consent and here's why:", 'Person A is drunk and Person B is not. A agrees to do sexual activities with B. In the morning A "regrets" the sexual act. In this case they were TOO INTOXICATED TO PROPERLY MAKE A DECISION. We all know alcohol impairs inhibitory control. So A appeared to give consent to an act that, while sober, they would not have. At the very best A has had a shitty night with B. More likely B has taken advantage of A because B was able to make a clear and informed decision while A was not. And B is well aware of the fact that alcohol made A more likely to sleep with them because we all went through freshman orientation so if B didn\'t know before college they damn well do now. Both of these options suck. You don\'t want to be in either of these situations regardless of whether you are A or B. And if you are B you are responsible for A\'s assault because you (consciously or not) used a drug to make A more likely to let you sleep with them.', "No one should have to worry about being taken advantage of sexually when drunk just like no one should have to worry about people coming up to them and asking them to sign contracts selling their soul away while drunk. Both of these situations are absurd and you shouldn't have to control how much you drink in order to avoid getting taken advantage of.\nSome people here have argued that it's impossible to expect that no one will commit crimes because there will always be robbers and murderers etc. And while this is true, THE VAST MAJORITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS are perpetrated by people known to the survivor. And plenty of sexual assaults could be prevented if EVERYONE had an extremely clear understanding of what consent means. At MIT it looks like this: https://studentlife.mit.edu/vpr/all-about-consent"]

Most negative effects for students come out of MIT\'s need to protect itself because of lingering In Loco Parentis BS.

I\'m not saying "I have an article; I\'m right", but here\'s an article from someone who is probably saying this more eloquently than me.']

['#7254 Giving advice on how to change possible sexual assault situations (more specifically looking at the "How can we change this?" bullets of post #7080) is great, and I think it\'s super important that people learn how to avoid/prevent dangerous situations. That being said, I have noticed a huge bias towards the assumption that the man is always the rapist, and the woman is always the survivor. I know that this is certainly the more common trend of sexual assaults, but I think that there is a blatant disregard for the fact that it happens the other way as well. I was raped (not during my time at MIT - it was before I came here), and have felt very uneasy about how the conversations around sexual assault go. I\'m struggling for the right words to describe it, but perhaps it\'s a lack of validation? The advice always suggests that the man is always the rapist in the assault, and even though I know it\'s important for the advice to be out there, it makes my past feel unimportant, and unacknowledged. I know this feeling stemmed from the fact that my own parents didn\'t believe me, but by fucking definition, what happened to me was rape. I said no, multiple times, and was overpowered. For some shitty reason, nobody every believed that I said no, or didn\'t want it. Apparently guys only want sex so clearly I wanted it. And the culture of my shitty home is appearing here, where everyone seems to think the only females need to give consent or only females can say no and mean it, that guys only want to fucking have sex. And I\'m not trying to invalidate the argument from a female\'s perspective! Just fuck this society, fuck this culture of rape, fuck the fact that some people don\'t understand the word "no".']

["#7245 MIT Confessions is a good example of fake news perpetuating. People writing strong opinions about MIT mental health (perhaps because they have a vendetta against them of a bad experience) and posting it as if it's facts. Post #7207 is a good example of where perpetuates misinformation by one person. Look mental health is complex issue and there is no one right way to fix it. It's hard to believe since we're all engineers and feel like things should be deterministic, but if we had already figured out the right way to tackle this issue, there would probably be a company making money off of it, but there isn't. As such, one person's experience with MIT Mental Health is NOT generalizable so please STOP saying it is. You can share your experience in a constructive manner but being super opinionated doesn't help anyone, especially the person who is suicidal. If anything, it can cause that person to take the wrong action and experience serious consequence. When it comes to helping other people with mental health issues, swallow your own ego and think about the other person, not what you went through."]

["#7238 Protecting yourself is still the best way to prevent crime. Doesn't matter what crime it is, whether it's rape, theft, mugging, even car accidents sometimes.", 'Just telling criminals to stop being criminals is wishful thinking. I mean yeah it\'d be nice if we could just say "Swiper no swiping" and then all the murderers and rapists and kidnappers would just say "aw man" and become civil members of society. Problem is that\'s just not how the world works. If you\'re a worthless piece of shit who kills innocent people, you\'ll probably always be a worthless piece of shit and nobody will be able to change that. If you\'re so fundamentally fucked up in the head that you think it\'s okay to rape someone, then just being told otherwise won\'t make you stop. Criminals will always be criminals. Telling rapists to just stop raping is no more effective than just telling terrorists to stop setting off bombs.', 'Crime is inevitable, so you should just do what you can to protect yourself. If you don\'t want your car to get stolen, you lock the doors and take the keys with you. If you don\'t want your house to be robbed, you lock the doors and get a security system.\nA great example is a 4-way intersection with a traffic light. If you\'re stopped at the red light, then it turns green and you go, but someone runs their red light and hits you. OBVIOUSLY it\'s their fault that the accident happened, but just saying "oh it\'s their fault" doesn\'t do any good if you\'re already dead. That\'s why you never drive through a green light without checking to make sure that nobody is about to run the red light. It\'s just common sense. Everybody agrees that you shouldn\'t just drive through a green light without checking first, but as soon as you say you shouldn\'t intentionally put yourself in vulnerable positions to be raped, everybody loses their mind.\nSelf-protection isn\'t specific to rape, everybody (men and women) do it in every aspect of their lives. I\'m a man, and I still carry a knife if I\'m out at night. When I\'m back home where it\'s legal, I carry a gun everywhere I go. I don\'t walk around at night alone, I lock the door to my car and house, and I don\'t get myself so drunk that literally anyone could take advantage of me. Obviously rapists are at fault for rape, but that doesn\'t make it rational to go out of your way to make yourself the easiest possible target.']

Right now, the world needs more human compassion, and I am not seeing any at all on these confession pages. When an extreme liberal responds in an isolating manner to a more moderate liberal, it\'s usually just going to push them farther away from wanting to support the "liberal agenda." (Some examples that I think are less black-and-white than liberals give them credit for: victim-blaming/safety precautions, trigger warnings, etc.) If you want to make a point, it is so much more effective to point out the validity in the other person\'s argument and then explain why it\'s not quite right, or to validate one part of an argument before disproving another part of it.', 'I really hope my MIT community can find a better way to have these important discussions, and can at least try to put themselves in the shoes of others before they respond to confessions in such a harsh manner.

A woman once accused me of stalking her even though I saw her so infrequently that it was literally only in class, and nowhere else. I'm someone with social anxiety, have never even flirted with anyone far less followed them around, have had silent crushes with painful outcomes, and now am afraid of walking outside, riding the bus, going to class, meeting with friends, and heaven forbid going anywhere near where she might be present (including events hosted by groups that she might be in, even though I'm interested for a totally different reason).", 'It is not sufficient to just say "if someone is not a perpetrator, the investigation will reveal him not to be so." Sometimes there is no investigation. There wasn\'t with me. It was just slander. She didn\'t need me to be arrested or investigated, because she wasn\'t actually afraid of me and I hadn\'t actually done anything wrong. She used the rightful goodwill of society in believing her story (we should consider all abuse threats as credible, etc.) to her own advantage, destroying my confidence in the process. Many of you will comment on here saying that I\'m a liar, and that is my point. Every woman must have her story treated as credible, and should have it investigated and resolved, both legally and in the eyes of the public. Every woman does not, however, have the right to ruin any man she chooses simply by telling a lie about him.', "I am 120% with the feminist movement, and I consider myself one, because I believe that what happened with me is rare and not the common trend in our society - most of the time, the woman is afraid to speak out even when she has been abused. I even advocate that the woman who spoke about me formally do so and make her case, so that a proper investigation be had (one that I'm not afraid of, since I did nothing wrong). But it is not ok to hide behind the guise of feminism to hurt other people."]

["#7197 Although I agree that the idea of a fraternity is extremely archaic and the sooner we move on from having living groups that can only recruit a single gender the better, why do people think that removing frats from campus would naturally reduce the number of rapes and sexual assaults? Fraternities are not really a concept outside of the US and yet in the UK and Australia, for example, as many as 1 in 10 women report being raped while at university. The problem lies much deeper in our global society, and university campuses appear to be one of the more prevalent locations where this occurs. Whether it is dorms, fraternities, or all men's sports teams, I think there is this hot-headed, aggressive attitude that develops within some men when they find themselves among a large groups of guys that compels them to feel that they can take what they want from a woman, whether she agrees or not.", 'So, what if we just get rid of frats? Well, we would still have all men\'s sports teams and other groups of men who hang out together, and I feel that it is natural that among these groups, guys will sometimes objectify women when they talk together ("XXX is so hot, did you see her instagram post yesterday..." or whatever) and groups of women do the exact same things back to men, and of course men do this to men, women to women, non-binary to non-binary etc etc. However, my fear is that when it is a a group of guys talking about women, in a small number of cases (but nonetheless more cases than when this conversation occurs for women talking about men etc), there will be a man in the group who will allow this momentary objectification to grow into an overall feeling that they can do whatever they want to a woman they find attractive. Sometimes it takes alcohol to bring out these feelings, and sometimes it does not.', 'I do not think that fraternities are the reason that men fundamentally do this more than any other group. All fraternities must want their members to treat women well and make them feel safe, first and foremost because that is just how people should be anyway, but also because the consequence of that not happening can be seen with TDC right now. (whether it was a TDC member or not who commited the rape, they are seeing the consequence of this reflect extremely negatively on their whole house). It has to be something deeper than that, something fundamentally wrong with our society that means that some men: (1) think that women say no to a guy to "play hard to get" and she really does actually want to have sex with him and he has to take charge to initiate sex and/or (2) extend the small levels of objectification that occur between every group from time to time into a deeper feeling that women are just objects for them to have sex with. I really have no idea how we solve that.']

Stop harassing the alleged perpetrator (emphasis on "alleged"): an investigation will show if he has done something wrong, not your internet trolling messages. Also, it seems like the feminist movement has become less about male/female equality and more about the willingness to destroy the lives of men. Don\'t get me wrong, if he has done something wrong, he should be punished. But stop thinking of sexual assault like it\'s some kind of trend. Understand the weight of your actions.']

['#7143 Dude, I am very excited to see how angry people are about rape on this campus. I’ve been screaming from the heavens that it’s an issue for 4 years. TDC is getting #Metoo’d like nobody’s business, and I’m loving it. People have felt able to voice their experiences, especially at that frat. Now here’s what I want: I think we all know TDC isn’t the worst example on our campus of this type of thing. I would liberally estimate they’re in 6th. We need to put our stories of bad frats out there, not only so we can weed out the worst apples, but so incoming freshman don’t come in and get swept up by the rush vans of frats that are going to turn them into worse people. I don’t know how we’re going to figure out how to show which frats are worst, as the mods on here wouldn’t want to post that (for understandable reasons. They’ve been roasted for publishing disparaging material before.) But we need to do something. TDC is not the problem, it’s just one of them.']

That is possibly why for the past Timely Warnings, the police don't have an ID for the perpetrator, because the victim possibly chose to not share it because he / she needs to do more emotional processing before he / she makes a decision as to how things should proceed legally. Timely Warnings are only made when a perpetrator is not identified to the police. Going to the police for an initial report or a hospital for DNA / STD testing etc. immediately is important for evidence for later for legal reasons, but emotional healing is also more important.", 'As someone who has been sexually assaulted in the past and have helped a lot of other people who had dealt with similar experiences, the best way to support someone who has been sexually assaulted is to provide emotional support, listening to them, asserting that it is not their fault, and turning them to resources like VPR, BARCC (the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center), S^3, and mental health.']

We need to make loud fucking noise until the Institute gets anxious enough about its image to take action. #NOTONEMORE.\nI don’t care if there are nice guys at TDC. This issue isn’t about individual people, and getting rid of the perpetrator or even shutting down TDC isn’t going to fully solve the problem.\nThis is the one case in which I think MIT should be more like Harvard. If the administration doesn’t want their shiny reputation to get tarnished, it’s way past time to get rid of every single fraternity on campus. Force them to decide between either being shut down or going coed, or if you don’t want to take such a hard stance, do some kind of sanctioning a la Harvard.\nI live in a fraternity, okay? I understand how much value these living groups can add to the communities and their members, but there’s no reason they should exist in a patriarchal, predominantly white power structure that insulates its members from a proper understanding of people of other genders. Anybody who doesn’t think Greek life is on its way out in American society is fucking oblivious, and I would be incredibly proud of MIT being one of the first universities to get as far away as possible from these weird ass national organizations run by old alumni who don’t have anything better to do than manage a bunch of frat houses, collect dues, and do their best not to wind up in the news.\nMajor props to the victims of the recent assaults for being brave enough to speak out, I’m so sorry this is your college experience. I wish I was doing more to fight for you than just posting a confession, but I wasn’t sure where to start.\nNot one more y’all.']

They "curved" the first exam upwards so that an A was above a 91/92 instead of a 90. People complained and the instructors said that it wasn\'t technically curving the test but that the 91 border was just to give people a sense of how well they met the class expectations (A is excelled in learning the concepts, B is good learning, C is adequate, etc). Sure, that\'s fair. Except now, they won\'t release our final exam grades (unless we really want to and then we can set up an appointment with the class moderator during the FALL SEMESTER), nor our final percentage, nor what constitutes an A or B or C. Everything is super hidden from the students and kind of sketchy. They usually finish grading exams in a day, but this time they said they\'ll try to give us our final class grade in a week. Are there any rules that say they have to be more transparent about grade cutoffs and curves and such?']

I’m posting on here because I’m looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement— please don’t hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don’t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(', 'Anyways, on with the question. I’m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don’t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in “female” activities such as putting on make up, liking “girlish” colors, and “speaking” like a girl? I guess what I’m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?', 'If this is the case, then why can’t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) “him” a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming “transgender (in this sense)?” Isn’t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?', 'TLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain “gender,” even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn’t exist according to the left? Please don’t hate on me :(']

At this point, I feel like a weight on my friends with my sadness and all I can do is just sit in my room and cry alone. I hope I will be able to carry on as a normal person.

I wish I didn't have to say this, but they're pretty incompetent and spread misinformation.\n#3) What I wrote before (#6940) is true between friends as well. Too many girls have a similar story to mine, because some guy they knew decided that a drunken evening was his best shot at finally getting some action. Don't be a dick (aka rapist), ESPECIALLY with people who trust you.\n#4) My tone doesn't reflect the gravity of this problem, because I'm exhausted. I don't want to resign to this problem. But don't worry, my fading bruises and daily meds remind me to stay angry. This is far more widespread than I can accept; my friends are suffering with me because their stories mirror mine.\n#5) IF YOU SEE A DRUNK GIRL- OFFER HER WATER AND RETURN HER TO HER FRIENDS. No one deserves to be violated because that extra shot had them acting a mess."]

I just broke up with my boyfriend after he became too “stressed out” and completely unresponsive, I’m being ghosted by my love of many years, and my crush who’s confessed his feelings isn’t being much better either. I couldn’t study all day for my final tomorrow because the campus was just full of people and everybody was being too loud and I just couldn’t focus. I’m going to have to pull an all-nighter, and guess what — just as I came in to the Athena cluster, I can’t even log in as it automatically logs me out. My best friend who was invited to my graduation is using me as free housing and is ditching me for the actual commencement. Shall I continue?', 'I know I’m just angry right now, and in a bit everything will seem better, maybe even tomorrow. But for now, I feel like all of these cumulatively give me a valid reason to be sad, and I’m afraid I’ll just fall deep into depression and won’t even be able to finish this semester. Or even if I do, when the time comes to celebrate, I will feel the loneliest and saddest I’ve ever been.', 'Anyway, good luck you guys! We got this!

Most universities have actual restaurants / fast food places on their campuses, and others have policies which kick out vendors with bad reviews. Even a small degree of accountability from dining staff or restaurant operators would go a long way.

I feel like the latter is just something people say because it would seem 'problematic' to suggest that Asians are inherently smarter. But, honestly, I feel like a lot of cultures, including American and European cultures, also encourage good study habits.

I've tried to kill myself, I'm trying to deal with severe depression, and people talking casually about suicide around me makes me start to get some of my old dangerous mindsets back. I don't care what people do when I'm not around but it shouldn't be too much to ask that they just stop when I'm there.\nP.S. If you joke about wanting to die *and you aren't actually depressed and are just doing it because it's a meme*, it's not funny."]

Pretty much everyone thinks I’m straight, and those who I’ve told about these feelings judge me for “not coming out of the closet sooner”.

['#4351 @4325 Interestingly, the founding fathers of the US in many ways reaped the benefits of the colonial system; they were all pretty well off. Was the revolution therefore unjustified? Free market ideas underly every aspect of our existence; this very platform is an example of that. Disagreeing with the status quo inherently means disagreeing with a system you live immersed in, and being immersed in a system indeed means many aspects of your way of life depend on it. But should being immersed in a system to the point of depending on it for the things you do in daily life mean you must be loyal to that system, that you are not justified in criticizing it or in feeling that certain aspects of it, even those you depend on and live off of, are in fact wrong?']

Take a normal class load. Be involved in a couple groups socially, but don't take on too much responsibility. Maybe you can't sleep 8hrs a night, but try to bump it up an hour.

These combined means I'm a pretty happy person, that I don't have much stress, and that life is going really well. So, yes, it can get better. It might depend on what your problems are (some people might need medication, and that's okay!). But depressed people can become happy and content - it doesn't end at functional."]

I really liked him, but it became too painful to be around him when I knew he was seeing someone else and when I was just a friend to him. At least meeting him showed me that there are good people out there in the world that could potentially be compatible with me and who could treat me well in a friendship or romantic relationship. I miss him though, but it's better to miss him from afar in this case since he's in a relationship, and I still have feelings for him :("]

The differences around slavery do not fade in a single generation. You seem to be very concerned about fault and blame - it\'s not your fault that your ancestors hold slaves. However, it is 100% worth talking about people who do and do not get advantages, including those tied to race. You\'re basically saying "Shut up, I don\'t want to hear about what advantages I\'ve gotten because I didn\'t choose the world to be like this!"

I know many of you are going to say that this is clingy af and not all boyfriends will be like this, but let my affection starved brain find some solace in the future pls. I love so many people (friends, family) but I also believe that if I were to die (or to be less morbid move away and lose contact) no one would really care. I guess my brain is telling me that a relationship is how my loneliness could be solved, but I can't find that either. I feel like to my friends I may come across clingy and I'm sorry for that. I'll back off and just deal I guess."]

I write this specifically cause one of the most amazing, strong, and feminist people I know had to make that decision and chose not to pursue action cause they were afraid of societal and family repercussions, and often beats themselves up about not pursuing some action due to posts like that. The point is, it's your choice, period, and imo you should not feel pressured/obligated in any direction about your choice to get them kicked out or not"]

This isn\'t on amateur photographers who hopefully know they suck and are trying to get better, it\'s on their friends who ask them to do photoshoots that end up with pictures anyone could have done. Your friends with no taste are devaluing the real skill it takes to make good images.']

There are guys in each class that are supportive and dedicated, but most are not. I've had multiple positions, including a year on exec, for years to maintain the brotherhood, but now I'm watching it crumble away despite my efforts. The worst part is having to look at our soft pledges this year."]

Our mixers are wack and our frat parties are deplorable. The frat party we had recently was a testament to this. Our brotherhood is pretty ok but, tbh, most of my brothers are a bunch of fairly asocial drunkards and high hippies. Participation in frat-related events has fallen dramatically and even some of the pledges don't even bother being at the events."]

Like, realistically how many upperclassmen were pretending to not be interested in frosh until today and suddenly were all over them, like everyone makes it seem is the case?

["#35 Timely confessions gonna get a timely death. The big boys over at the real mit confessions are back in action. Y'all can't run a page for shit. Curating a page is like an art gallery. Ya can't just put any shit that comes through the door up and call it art. You gotta be selective and understand the audience. You gotta be spontaneous not a weekly turn the cog kinda deal. Y'all failed and you know it."]
