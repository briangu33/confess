["#5566 I don't know why I suck at dating so much. I'm decently attractive, like to think I'm an interesting conversationalist. But I dunno man, I just haven't found the one yet, haven't clicked. I'm not a very emotional person, so maybe people interpret that as lack of interest. I mean on top of it my parents remind me dating comes secondary to getting an education( immigrants you see, 2nd person in family to go to college). Lol could be because I'm fairly conservative as well, ah well I'll just keep looking😉"]
