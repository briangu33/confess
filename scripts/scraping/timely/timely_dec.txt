I know many of you are going to say that this is clingy af and not all boyfriends will be like this, but let my affection starved brain find some solace in the future pls. I love so many people (friends, family) but I also believe that if I were to die (or to be less morbid move away and lose contact) no one would really care. I guess my brain is telling me that a relationship is how my loneliness could be solved, but I can't find that either. I feel like to my friends I may come across clingy and I'm sorry for that. I'll back off and just deal I guess."]

I write this specifically cause one of the most amazing, strong, and feminist people I know had to make that decision and chose not to pursue action cause they were afraid of societal and family repercussions, and often beats themselves up about not pursuing some action due to posts like that. The point is, it's your choice, period, and imo you should not feel pressured/obligated in any direction about your choice to get them kicked out or not"]

Now I feel like ive dealt all my cards out to the wrong player.. Betrayal feels like rage rising. soon imma curse you, everything you like, everything you stand for, everything you dream of, but just keeping it PG on here so it will be posted, but you should know to expect something when we get home. Sit and try to figure out who this is now. I am in no mood during finals."]

Like 85% of Cubans are directly descended from the Spanish, the same ones who virtually wiped out all of Cuba\'s Native population and proceeded to silence their voices. You are a new generation and had no say in the matter, but you still have the audacity to call yourselves "natives" like Cuba was yours to begin with. There are no more Tainos in Cuba. Cuba had no Mestizaje. Think before you post young one.']

Maybe it’s immature. But I think it’s best if I continue to stay at a distance.']
