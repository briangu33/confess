Always thought that a friends w benefits / booty calls were the things you had to make clear, and a relationship was the status quo, rather than the other way around. Tbh I still think campus hookup culture is weird.']

["#3923 @3896 I'd call myself better from depression. It seems my depression had two causes - one, my way of thinking was broken, and two, my environment was hugely stressful. For the first, I worked on CBT to change my general attitude towards life and my expectations, and for two... well, I graduated from MIT. These combined means I'm a pretty happy person, that I don't have much stress, and that life is going really well. So, yes, it can get better. It might depend on what your problems are (some people might need medication, and that's okay!). But depressed people can become happy and content - it doesn't end at functional."]

I am proud that this school offers a lot of social opportunities for its students, but I feel like more people need to take advantage; like its cool to discuss my academic passion, but I kinda wish more people would know hip hop lyrics, skateboarding, prob play some sports and use less jargon. Sure smart is sexy, but its important to be in touch with things outside your major. Overall, I think appreciate of being able to BALANCE social life and academic passions is ever so crucial... more thoughts to come (lmk what topics you guys are interested in)---- signed A.K.S (p1/3)', 'p2 - relationship/ hook up culture in Boston\np3 - career and FOMO']
