There\'s still plenty of revolutionary research going on! LIGO measured gravitational waves just last year! CRISPR research is only just getting started! People still die from diseases and lack clean water and infrastructure and our energy needs are still being met with non-renewables. I think what you really mean is "I wish I had gone to MIT 20-30 years ago when MIT didn\'t make me feel like my only options were heading straight into some giant tech conglomerate for a lifetime of working as a cog in their optimization machine".']
