      "['#1140 For the love of christ, if you don’t like trans women, no one is forcing you to sleep with them. Unless you’re posting bc you want people to challenge your view, this whole conversation seems unproductive and bad to have over the internet. Please stop. There are plenty of people who would not sleep with me, as a tall girl, and if I had to wade through a fuck ton of confessions about that, it would be really hurtful to me. You don’t go around saying, “I wouldn’t sleep with you” to people! Try it, folks, see how far it gets you! You wouldn’t say to Carrie (for example because she has been commenting, and also because she is a freshman girl and it is upsetting for me to see such a young woman feel attacked like this in a public forum) “I wouldn’t sleep with you,” even if you wouldn’t, BECAUSE SHE ALSO PROBABLY DOESN’T WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU (like most women don’t if you have an attitude like that, tbh), AND IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT MATTER ABOUT US WOMEN OTHER THAN OUR FUCKABILITY. And also, if she were interested in you, you would be damn lucky, she’s a delightful girl. But even if she were not, she and others like her do not deserve this treatment on confessions. Maybe just don’t spew hate. Like there are groups that I am prejudiced against but I don’t go around advertising it and I try not to let it affect my interactions with them. How hard is that? Also, bonus round: why do you think it is that we police trans WOMEN on their sexual desirability... oh look, misogyny, my old friend, come to tell women we only are valuable insofar as we turn people on! Turns out our trans sisters reveal a special strain of the hate directed against women more generally! Yay winning. Ugh.']\n",
