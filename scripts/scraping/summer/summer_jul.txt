I'm black, and 100% of my white mentors (3 so far) have become condescending when meeting me in person AFTER knowing I'm completely reasonable, well-spoken, and intelligent through e-mail. They've all insulted my intelligence even when we have discussions where I correct them, sometimes on very obvious mistakes. In contrast, I've had two asian mentors who never did such a thing. It's so fucking petty - I can't believe I can't just have an objective discussion with fucking scientists. It fills me with seething rage that something as inconsequential as skin color plays such a factor in getting the job of my dreams, and I can never bring it up, otherwise I'M the one that brings race into it. I lost a fucking publication because a mentor's such an asshole.\nJesus Fucking Christ. I am so fucking pissed. I don't want to keep playing these stupid fucking games."]

When I first came to MIT, it was the same way, and I really neglected my family relationships and the relationships I valued with friends from home for the first six months or so before I had enough of a handle on my new environment to be able to put energy into those relationships again. Once I get through this adjustment period, I absolutely want to maintain and grow those relationships, I just usually don't make it to other side of that adjustment period over the summer. Tbh, the first few months after I graduate, I probably will be mostly off the grid in most of my relationships, but after I get past those first few months, I'll pop back up and it doesn't mean that I don't value the relationship!"]

['#1054 Asians are disadvantaged in comparison to white people, but because of the ""model minority"" stereotype, asians are often treated as even more advantaged than whites in America, and a lot of people like to knock us down a peg, or use us as an excuse to discriminate other minority races. I\'m annoyed that the only races that people ever talk about are white, hispanic, and black, and when asians are mentioned, it becomes a conversation specifically about south asians. It just sucks being jerked around and used as convenient evidence to prove all sorts of stupid and bigoted arguments.\n""Asians do well in america so other minorities are just lazy""\n""Asians are richer and more educated as a minority group so they should be judged harder in college applications""\n""Whites and asians are racist against minorities""\n""Minorities and asians are entitled assholes""', "The model minority does not mean we are the same as white people, or get the same advantages, and there is still a big disadvantage that asians face in leadership and all sorts of non-tech positions. We are a minority group facing discrimination, but it is also fair to say we are not facing quite as much discrimination as other minority groups. Please just stop using us as a tool for your stupid conversations if you won't let us have our own."]

['#780 OP of the post asking why there are a few obsessive commenters in confessions thread, I‚Äôve had some time to think about the topic since then and would like to present my hypothesis ‚Äî', 'First, some key observations -', '1. The original post got responses from the ‚Äòsubjects‚Äô such as ‚Äúit‚Äôs not deep‚Äù and ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt take much time‚Äù (vis-√†-vis the comments). Surely, that‚Äôs not a satisfactory reason. Amount of time something takes isn‚Äôt a explanation for doing it in the first place, and there are many more followers on the page so that begs the question why only these few people.\n2. Majority (>90%) of the subjects‚Äô comments are extremely left/liberal leaning.\n3. And now for a controversial statement, but one that is central to my hypothesis - most of the subjects aren‚Äôt very attractive/pretty (in the usual sense of the word.)\n4. Social validation is an innate human desire and social media often provides a platform for seeking the same.', 'Hypothesis - There are two ways of unlocking likes at scale on social media - either by being pretty or witty. Since most of the subjects aren‚Äôt very pretty, their only other option is being witty.', 'This is why you see the subjects often trying to out-smart, out-intellect, out-wit, out-moral other posts on confession. A tinge of virtue-signaling completes the recipe for likes and heart reacts. Reciprocity is also included (known as circle-jerking in common parlance). This relates to point 2 since in the college climate of social media, liberal values are already accepted and rewarded, thus incentivizing the types of comments we see.', 'Of course much of this behavior is sub-consciously assimilated, and therefore the subjects display a lack of self-awareness for their behavioral-pattern (see point 1).', 'The subjects have figured out the key to social media validation that works for them and I believe their behavior, at least partly, can be explained by my conjecture.', '(PS- I‚Äôm aware this is going to be attacked by my subjects as this clearly would hurt their ego, though I‚Äôd hope better arguments that refute central points made here rather than the typical ad-hominem, straw-mans, and attacking the tone.)']

For context, I'm AMAB and I've been questioning for about a year, now embracing parts of transition and leaning towards normal medical and social transition in the future.", 'Here are some observations/opinions from my life: it seems that gender identity is largely social and mostly a choice, but it‚Äôs heavily motivated by gender dysphoria, an innate and immutable psychological condition. Almost every trans person ""chooses"" to change name/pronouns, but nobody chooses to feel an intense discomfort towards their primary and secondary sex characteristics or towards their treatment within society as a particular gender. I wasn‚Äôt born my preferred gender, I was born with a condition eventually resulting in strong distress with my sex and gender. This point of view doesn‚Äôt seem too uncommon, but it‚Äôs not pushed externally, probably because bigots w/o nuance can easily take it as an admission that trans people are just ~mentally ill~. Even if it isn‚Äôt universally agreed upon, the point of view that gender is an essential characteristic to a person is politically attractive, which is why I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs pushed so much.', 'On the rest of your post: when has anybody suggested that being trans automatically changes your sex? Medical transition can change one‚Äôs sex to a reasonable degree (obviously, via changes to hormones and several sexual characteristics), but I don‚Äôt think any reasonable activists have suggested that a change to one‚Äôs gender always implies a change to one‚Äôs sex.', 'Honestly, I see all of the inane comparisons to trans-*ism as equivocation between identities which fly in the face of an obvious biological reality (granting for the sake of discussion that race is an obvious biological reality) and identities which don‚Äôt really say anything about biology. Imo it all boils down to the assertions that gender and sex are different, that gender bends by almost definition to one‚Äôs feelings, and that sex can be partially changed via methods already common for trans people.']

["#1039 I'm a rising senior and I'm realizing that tbh I really hate the way I've been interacting with people for the past couple years here. I really like to be helpful and I'm worried that if I can't be useful to others then they won't want me around ever but that has sort of morphed into my consideration for others being constantly taken for granted. I've started to notice that people take advantage of my willingness to help low-key all the time and then turn around and treat me like shit or take credit for my work or both. When I tell people that this makes me uncomfortable then I'm suddenly a massive bitch or a needy credit whore. I just want the time I put into my work and my friendships to mean something but I've come to understand that no one cares about me as a person unless I'm helping them out. I also had a few notable falling-outs with people last year and my core group of friends all decided that they didn't want to hang around me anymore and started leaving me out of everything while still finding ways to rub that in my face or ask me for favors. Let it be said that I never bothered them with my issues and have also been called on in the past to counsel them through their own shit. Last semester I had a couple days where I was done with the people in my living group doing this and was distant (not smiling or waving). Several of my friends got together to talk about how I was a huge fucking problem. At this point I realized that any emotion I express that isn't perfectly happy and smiling is seen as a character defect, that people leaving me out or saying legitimately cruel things is to be expected and any issue I take with that is also a character defect, and the incredible amount of effort I put into making sure the people around me are okay is expected behavior and nothing to be noticed or mentioned ever. I'm really sorry for the long rambling confession and thanks for making it all the way through my shitty paragraph. I know that this isn't like a huge world problem and I'm sorry for bothering people with my relatively minor issues but I just wanted to get this off my chest and I think that's what confessions is for. All in all, I'm willing to take responsibility for things that I've handled poorly or times that I've lashed out or been frustrated but I'm sick and tired that my patience and kindness are both exploited and ignored.", "tl;dr people suck and i'm done"]

['#795 @ the first commenters on #775. Might as well call you out Alula and Katherine since you asked (haha)', 'I sincerely believe it is possible to understand race in America, support the reasoning behind affirmative action, and still oppose it in college admissions. I come from an area of the US that is in the 0th percentile of income and education in the US and is also 98% white. Our schools get grants for computers but have nobody to teach students how to use them, so some of my classmates graduate high school and don\'t know how to even type. Our students stop and pick up roadkill so they have something to eat (I have too), but for some reason African Americans who are richer and have far better resources get a step up because of an ""impoverished group"" status. Nearly any argument used for affirmative action also applies to groups of white Americans in the Ohio Valley, central Appalachians, and other places that have been impoverished for generations.', "None of these lawsuits are arguing that we shouldn't preferentially admit people who scored lower on standardized tests but who have limited education access, the are only arguing that we shouldn't generalize this way based on race.", "Also, this realistically won't change that much about how elite schools admit applicants, as they can just substitute lack of access and tenacity/work ethic instead of race. But if this case succeeds, it will require colleges to judge people based on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin, and I can get behind that"]

["#1096 Unpopular opinion: Roe v Wade is a garbage SCOTUS decision. The deciding factor was that restricting or banning access to abortion is a violation of an implied right to privacy given by the Fourteenth Amendment. But the Fourteenth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Declaration of Independence explicitly argue that everyone has a right to life. I prefer that these documents be interpreted according to their text and the intentions of the people who wrote them at the time. I can guarantee that none of the Founding Fathers thought that abortion was even remotely okay. Call me a textualist and an originalist (or a strict constructionist if that term's still used), but the idea of the courts stretching these documents beyond their words and intent is scary to me. It basically gives the Supreme Court a legislative power even though the Supreme Court is part of the judicial branch and not the legislative branch. (I have the same problem with executive orders FWIW).", "If you want to argue that it's applicable in cases of rape or incest (which comprise a very small minority of abortions in America), fine. But I consider a developing baby in the womb to be a person, no matter what stage of development they're in. Let's focus on the overwhelming majority of abortions, where a woman had consensual sex. Ladies, if you're going to have sex (especially unprotected), you should be old enough and mature enough to understand the risks and to handle getting pregnant and giving birth if it happens. You don't get to kill another living being growing inside you just because you made a bad sexual decision or a mistake. It's called taking responsibility for your body.", 'Oh, and I\'m female, so don\'t even fucking think of saying that I\'m ""mansplaining"" or trying to control women\'s bodies.

Then over time you continue to engage in positive emotional activities with the other person (pursuing your own interests in a social context is a good starter way to do this), strengthening the connection, and at some point, also engage regarding past individual emotional experiences and often, connect via empathy (if you're empathy is not super developed, don't worry, you can learn) which produces more positive feelings associated with you and at this point, you've probably formed a social attachment."]

If a bystander doesn't like any of these, they can just look away.

So, I think that the above list of activities should be legal for the same reason as we have freedom of speech/religion, the right to wear whatever clothes you want etc. Even if someone is annoyed or disturbed by your views/religion/clothing/public defecation, satisfying your preference to act in that way is more important than others' annoyance (in these cases)."]

["#958 I'd like to offer another perspective on the discussion about affirmative action.", 'There is widespread anti-AA sentiment among Asian-American communities (especially immigrants and second-generation immigrants). From the Asian-American point of view, even if race-based AA is justified (e.g. because American society owes some debt to racial minorities that have been slighted due to racism in the past), in the current system it seems that Asians take (an unfairly large part of) the fall.', 'Historically, the only Asian males to be admitted to MIT from my high school have been top scorers on some national math/science olympiad, or had some other similarly prestigious achievement. Among my classmates, there was a widespread (and not entirely unfounded) perception that the only way to be admitted to MIT as an Asian male was to win the USA[insert letter]O, while the bar was not quite as high for other groups.', "From my parents' perspective, they sacrificed a lot to immigrate to the US so that their children could have better educational opportunities. Race-based AA policies disadvantage their children in college admissions, threatening their dreams of securing a better life for their children. (For similar discussion, see https://www.newyorker.com/‚Ä¶/why-asian-americans-feel-powerl‚Ä¶ )"]

["#1268 If ladies talk about weird looking dicks it's just like another hilarious Thursday on The View, but heaven forbid a dude says something about a funny looking snatch and all of a sudden he's the walking embodiment of the patriarchy condemning women for their bodies and imposing unrealistic body standards. Some you ladies have laughable labia, and some dudes just have dubious looking dicks. It's a fact of life and I think we should be able to have a good laugh at anomalous sets of genitals no matter their construction."]

['#1207 Race is a social construct it is racist to give blanket statements like ""I don\'t find anyone of XXX race attractive."" Gender is also a social construct, and it is transphobic to say ""I am attracted to ciswomen but not transwomen.""(1) So then, when we talk about sexuality, are we only referring to the specific gender labels that someone is open to dating? That seems pretty dumb to do since gender is a social construct, we don\'t make these distinctions for other social constructs like race, etc. that have similarly large effects on how society treats you. But then, it\'s also true that most people accept that being LGBT+ isn\'t a choice. Can\'t this be used to argue against (1)? Isn\'t there a contradiction to claiming that sexuality re: attraction to particular genders is rigid, but nothing else is?', 'It seems really weird to me that we just accept that, for example, if a man is gay then it\'s fine that he makes the blanket statement that he\'s ""not attracted to any women."" We would want him to consider dating people of all races, and to consider dating men who were and were not amab, so why is ""nah, no women, ever"" fine? Why aren\'t people arguing that you should keep an open mind about dating any kind of person?']

['#1140 For the love of christ, if you don‚Äôt like trans women, no one is forcing you to sleep with them. Unless you‚Äôre posting bc you want people to challenge your view, this whole conversation seems unproductive and bad to have over the internet. Please stop. There are plenty of people who would not sleep with me, as a tall girl, and if I had to wade through a fuck ton of confessions about that, it would be really hurtful to me. You don‚Äôt go around saying, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt sleep with you‚Äù to people! Try it, folks, see how far it gets you! You wouldn‚Äôt say to Carrie (for example because she has been commenting, and also because she is a freshman girl and it is upsetting for me to see such a young woman feel attacked like this in a public forum) ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt sleep with you,‚Äù even if you wouldn‚Äôt, BECAUSE SHE ALSO PROBABLY DOESN‚ÄôT WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU (like most women don‚Äôt if you have an attitude like that, tbh), AND IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT MATTER ABOUT US WOMEN OTHER THAN OUR FUCKABILITY. And also, if she were interested in you, you would be damn lucky, she‚Äôs a delightful girl. But even if she were not, she and others like her do not deserve this treatment on confessions. Maybe just don‚Äôt spew hate. Like there are groups that I am prejudiced against but I don‚Äôt go around advertising it and I try not to let it affect my interactions with them. How hard is that? Also, bonus round: why do you think it is that we police trans WOMEN on their sexual desirability... oh look, misogyny, my old friend, come to tell women we only are valuable insofar as we turn people on! Turns out our trans sisters reveal a special strain of the hate directed against women more generally! Yay winning. Ugh.']

["#980 I make ~400 a week post-tax from my UROP and summer rent is about 240 a week. In the past month I spent essentially nothing on anything else aside from food so I could afford take out every day (the mezze platter from the greek restaurant plus a bunch of avocados from target is enough to last me a day for about $13) . Sure it's not cushy unlike tech company interns but it's possible to live with. Also as an international I'm not so sure about the credit system in the US but it shouldn't be too hard to get a small loan, like $500-$1000 just to be significantly more comfortable? Your comfort and increased productivity as a result is worth more than the loan plus interest."]
