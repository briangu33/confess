["#427 @388 Reminder that Asians don't automatically get access to free test tutors because they're asian (same goes for any other race). Test tutors are undeniably a privilege for those who can afford it, and plenty of asian-american families can't.\nI'm not saying that asian american students don't get some benefit from a highly pro-academic culture, but this culture only developed among asian-american communities because strong academics are viewed as the least subjective way to prove that an asian-american is worth giving a job/scholarship/opportunity to. This culture is in place precisely to ward off discrimination, not because asians are innately pro-education from birth. Also a reminder that many asian-american families push education to an abusive extent, and many (not all) successful asian-american students have been physically and emotionally abused over their academic performance throughout their childhood.\nIt's easy to say you wish your parents pushed you when you were a kid, or you wish you grew up in an asian-american culture of education if you haven't faced getting beaten and screamed at daily for not doing well enough in academic competitions.", "There are plenty of asian-americans who are low-income, have faced discrimination over their race, and/or come from abusive backgrounds.

['#515 I swear, nothing annoys me more than when people act like pro-life people are trying to ""control women\'s bodies"". Literally nobody thinks that. No pro-life proponent is trying to control my body. That\'s such an unbelievably fringe opinion. It\'s one of the most hilariously obvious straw man arguments I\'ve ever seen (second only to some of Trump\'s arguments). It\'s an indication of how little the left actually thinks about opposing arguments. Acting like the abortion issue has something to do with ""women\'s rights"" is so far removed from the crux of the argument, that it just shrouds their whole side in illegitimacy. The entire damn argument is nothing more than ""do fetuses have moral value, and thus cannot be killed because that\'d be murder; or do they not have moral value, and thus can be killed at any time; or perhaps a grey area where they\'re have some moral value, more than zero but less than a living human, and so can be killed under certain sets of circumstances."" Women\'s rights are not a part of that discussion, except perhaps in the last case (which isn\'t the pro-life case, of course). If you\'re pro-life, you\'re pro life because you think it\'s immoral to kill unborn babies, not because of some weird ass idea that you want to control women.', 'This idea that pro-life people are trying to control women\'s bodies is not only preposterous and ignorant, but it\'s just plain fucking insulting. I\'m certainly a feminist, and I demand full control over my own body, but I\'m still pro-life because I believe that a baby inside of me is NOT ""my body"". It\'s the baby\'s body which happens to be inside me. I don\'t get to just go murdering it because I don\'t want it to be alive anymore, regardless of my reason for wanting it gone.', "By all means, there certainly are very reasonable arguments for abortion that I do find compelling (like abortion after a rape, I'll admit that one makes me feel very conflicted about my position), but you hurling insulting straw man arguments at me to belittle the validity of my opinion is not the way to go, people.", 'P.S. also annoying is when people accuse me of being brainwashed or manipulated because I\'m a female pro-life supporter. I\'m a grown woman, I can make my own fucking opinions. You call yourself a feminist, but imply that my opinions must not be my own just because I\'m a woman? Fuck you."']

But what most men don't seem to understand is that the reason it's much easier for the average woman to attract a man is because the average woman puts soooooo much more time, energy, and money into being sexually desirable than the average man does.", 'If you\'re a man going ""poor me, it\'s not fair, it\'s so easy for women to have sex,"" ask yourself when was the last time you plucked your eyebrows? Waxed something, if your appearance would benefit from that (which for most people, it would)? Have you figured out exactly what clothes are flattering to your body and do you almost exclusively wear those? Have you figured out the most flattering haircut and styling for you? What about your facial hair? What\'s your skincare routine like?

['#636 According to Confucius, being filial to our parents is the utmost expression of respect. This is an essential element in obtaining the title of chun-tzu, or noble person. However, filial piety is not a one-way street. Parents must also be filial to their children and to their parents. Both parent and child have a natural position and responsibility within the family; therefore natural filial piety is reciprocal. It is through recognizing and practicing filial piety in the family that a person will know how to act outside of the family. For in the Confucian tradition, it is realized that filial piety also exists between all beings. This is evident in the Confucian Golden Rule, which is sometimes referred to as the Silver Rule: "Do not do unto others what you would want them to not do unto you.']

When I was younger and my parents fought constantly, I used to have those images as well and I would often cry myself to sleep because I knew I don't have the guts in me to do anything close to what I was imaging. It was comforting, for sure - at least take my mind off the background noise and the complicated emotions circulating in the house. But, when I later look back on it, it was a clear sign that I was suffering through some sort of anxiety and depression.", "I am not saying that you may have anxiety and/or depression, but having vivid images of yourself attempting suicide is not great to your state of mind. When life hits me in the face, after dwelling in negative emotions, I force myself to look realistically at my situation and what I can do to get myself back on my feet. If I can't see anything at first, I keep on thinking and thinking and do something (who knows pick up a book to read, watch tv shows, go outside and treat myself to some Starbucks drink, etc) so that I can get things moving. I believe that I can move away from the negative space that I found myself in by doing simple things that will get me moving even when I can't see the way out."]

Colleges are actively discriminating against them for seemingly no reason other than to admit other students of different races to promote diversity. Which is not a bad thing in and of itself.

['#322 Some of y\'all are legit dumbasses that sound like a fuckin bot, do you not see how hyprocritical and privileged af it is to constantly see all these complaints about individuals gaining weight and u trya and say some shit about how it is objectively privileged garbage and then they attack you for starving saying I can do something about it much more readily than some person who even if they feel hungry just needs to eat less, there is literally an action that requires 0 money or time, two things I\'d love more of. I\'m pointing out how fucked you all are and you\'re just making it easier with your garbage arguments. What I\'m trying to say is unless you all are comfortable with people talking about starving without attacking them u shouldn\'t say a damn word to defend these people baraginy confessions with "Im gaining weight poor me".
