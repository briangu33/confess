["#2443 Ok so I got really bored the past couple of days and started posting random avatar the last airbender quotes. I started trying to be as discreet as possible but every quote was basically exclusive to the show (i.e. look any of them up and you'll only get search results about avatar). I did this just to see if either a) people would catch the reference or b) if/how people would react anyway to them, and then made my quotes less and less subtle while still not including any obvious signs that it was from the show (i.e. including names, etc.) until somebody clearly caught the reference (thanks XhiDae). In case anybody's curious (which probably nobody is anyway but heh) the quotes are #2358 (from The Southern Raiders), #2389 (from the finale), #2426 (from Tales of Ba Sing Se), #2431 (from The Ember Island Players). I'm glad to see the last one at least was obvious enough for people to catch."]

["#2373 My best friend fell in love with me, but I didn't share his feelings(although I loved him a lot, but not in a romantic way, I guess). I tried to not tell him how I felt about him, because I don't fell comfortable expressing my feelings. But he knew I didn't love him back(while everyone else thought that we were a couple).After a few months he started acting differently. He was rude and wasn't caring that much anymore. When I got an operation, I was expecting he'd want to come and see me, but he didn't even mention it. On his birthday, I was waiting for him, to give him a big hug, but it seemed like he was avoiding me. Then my patience came to an end. I asked him what had happened, and he told me that he tried to make the love go away. He said he wanted to be just friends, but it was hard for him. He said that nothing was going to be the same, that he'll try to treat me better, but he won't be the guy who was in love with me. We started fighting a lot. We would fight and then act as if everything was fine, and we'd talk as cute as we used to, but then fight again. Eventually, on Christmas eve, we had a huge fight because of something really stupid, which he considered something really important. And I tried to fix the situation, while he was blaming me for making it worse. I texted him 4-5 times, with periods between them, and then I gave up, because he wouldn't try. Time passed, and it was really hard for me. I missed him a lot, as he was my everything. But he seemed alright without me. I wanted him to feel what I felt, to suffer the way I suffered. I wanted him to realize he couldn't live without me. But he didn't do anything. After a month or more he texted me, and my heart was beating really fast, but I acted cool. The conversation didn't last long. As time passed, I started feeling that I hate him. It took me a lot of time to get over him. But even now, when I see him happy without me, I get jealous. I just wanted him to fight for me. What if I'd love him back?"]

['#2317 This actually sounds fairly easy - definitely doable. Last fall I took 6.854, 6.172, 6.830, 6.867, 6.860, 6.438, 6.829, 18.404 and several math classes (18.02 included lmao as I was supposed to ASE it but didnt feel like going to ASE duing orientation). For HASS I decided to balance it out and take 21M.301 which was pretty easy for me since I already been doing music. Despite having a UROP which ended up with a publication in ICML, I ended up getting almost all As and A+ grades though in 6.438 I somehow managed to get a B+ (fml right?). Tbh I am not even that smart its just that its over-exagerated by many people how difficult these classes are - theyre hard of course but doable. I didnt even have any of the pre-reqs and hadnt written a line of code before. Maybe thats why I got a B+ in 438. It was all good though since it was just my first semester and was on PNR.']

I barely averaged 2.5 hours of work a day and the only things I managed to do was code a few solvers whose methods aren\'t really new, run a bunch of random test cases, and prove a lemma that\'s too specific to be really useful. It took me the entire summer to get less than a thousand lines of code. Am I supposed to believe he honestly thinks this is a ""good job""?']

["#2309 I've experienced two years of college and I think I finally understand myself. My problem isn't social anxiety. My problem is that I have a shitty personality. When I see a person, my first reaction is not to want to be friends with them, but rather to pick at their flaws and wonder if being friends with them would be worthwhile. I'm not sure I really understand what friendship is supposed to mean.", "But what can I do with this? Is it possible to fundamentally change someone's personality, someone's view of the world that they pretty much inherited from their cynical and stupid parents? Can I even do this without losing who I am?", "I need help, but can I really accept help when I can't help but look down on the people who try to help me, as if they did not have the capability of understanding my problem?", "Would there be ways of fixing my problems without changing myself? I've tried pretending, acting through a different personality in order to make myself a more likable person -- after all, using people in order to satisfy your craving for social interactions does not necessarily require actually appreciating the people that help you -- but all that does it tire me out and leave me disgusted. I'm a hypocrite; I need people and their help yet I reject and hate people by default.", "I think I've noticed this subconsciously for a long time. I've always wanted something that would completely destroy my pride and arrogance. I was told by many that coming to MIT would do it, but it didn't and made it worse.", "I know that I don't stand above other people. I know that I can't survive without the help of the people I despise so much. But when something like this comes from the depths of your heart, no matter how I try to rationalize it, no matter how convincing mine or anyone else's arguments are, I can't change myself. Because the problem is not that I need something to achieve a certain goal, but rather that my goals, my values themselves are selfish, arrogant, and do not include other people.", 'How do you change someone like this?', "I've never seen events, real or even fiction, in which people change their values. But people aren't born with their values, they learn them. So I'm hopeful that I can be changed.", 'How did you come to have the values you do now? Was there any idea, concept, or just a bit of information that affected your values a lot?']

["#2244 The other day (8/23) there was a ton of free food in building 66. Quite a few people showed up, but there was plenty to go around. Then an East Campus resident showed up and piled up 3 platters (there was a 2nd person with him, cannot recall if they took anything too), close to half of the food available. Several people tried to stop him from doing so, explaining that he was taking food from others streaming from across campus. He left anyway. I just wanted to tell that person: you are despicable. Sure, you're taking the food not only for yourself, so that might make you feel less selfish. But to use the free food mailing list as a personal catering service for you community is basically stealing food from the mouths of the hungriest people on campus. It's one thing if you're doing so naively, but to continue doing so over in-person protests is disturbing."]

Damn it that's a hard question. But there's gotta be a top node dealing with color preferences in people.

Now that I've come to MIT and learned a lot more about sex, I'm slowly realizing how insanely problematic my last high school relationship was, in terms of lack of consent and wildly inappropriate sexual overstepping. Now that I know how much stuff was done to me that was very not okay, I've felt increasingly violated and instinctively wary of committing to another relationship. But I also feel a bit unjustified, because what I felt when these things actually happened was a fraction of what I feel now, and it's like changing my mind after the fact which is unfair or something. Idk. Anybody else have similar experiences?"]

So much advertising revolves around evocative sexual imagery, which apparently gets people to buy stuff well enough that ""sex sells"" is a standard. People will do horrible things like rape a friend, just driven by a desire to fuck. Women are groped in broad public daylight just because what, some creep wants to touch a boob that bad? Imagine if suddenly grabbing a stranger\'s arm or face in public was normalized, or treated as somewhat understandable, like groping is. As an asexual, I don\'t think I can ever understand the raw power that sex has on people, and floating through a world where the vast majority of people are driven by this thing I can\'t understand is really\nterrifying. Any fellow aces have thoughts about this?']

How can California and its citizens claim to be so liberal if this state has such large homeless epidemic in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and in other places? It's really disappointing to see that a state that prides itself with being so progressive cannot even provide housing for the most disadvantaged in our society. Ironically a lot of wealthy techies are partly responsible for this situation. I really hope that Silicon Valley's wealthy techies stand up for the homeless if they have any moral conscience at all."]

['#1864 One thing I don\'t understand about myself is how I cannot handle loneliness *at all*. I\'ve been trying for years to get over it, trying to be on my own for a bit to fully embrace myself. I have been seeing a therapist, taking meds, meditating, blah blah, but nothing is helping. Everytime I\'m left alone for more than half a day or I feel like I\'m being sidelined in a group, I rapidly fall into a depressive spiral to the point of suicidal ideation. As soon as I\'m around people who genuinely care about me, though, all of these thoughts and feelings just evaporate. I\'ve somehow managed to survive this far by desperately trying to surround myself with caring people, but sometimes they\'re not around, and I just lack the charm or overall ""interestingness"" to get close to many people. I don\'t know what to do. I can\'t tell my therapist because I\'m certain I\'ll get involuntarily hospitalized, and that won\'t really solve anything.', "I'm just constantly at war with my mind—this is definitely one thing I would want to change about myself if I could.

It sounds condescending but it’s true. My ex partner would literally go around telling people how much she liked dating a freshman because “he’s so easy to control” We were wanting to go into the same industry for work, So my friendships depended on her, my networking depended on her, my access to social scenes around campus depended on her, everything did. Imagine the environment that creates, that your “partner” can do whatever the hell they want to you, because if you leave, you lose everything connected to MIT around you, because that person had their hands in every part of their life for the sole fact that they’ve been here longer than you have.']

['#1705 Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n... But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\nAnd one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.”\n—Milton Mayer, *They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45*']

Then, when you feel the time has finally come tell her that you aren't actually interested in friendship, you wanted a romantic relationship this entire time. When she isn't comfortable with this, tell her you can't be friends with her anymore because you like and care for her a lot."]

If a bystander doesn't like any of these, they can just look away. Someone's consent is necessary in situations where the action could potentially harm that someone as much or more as others have to gain from it. So, I think that the above list of activities should be legal for the same reason as we have freedom of speech/religion, the right to wear whatever clothes you want etc. Even if someone is annoyed or disturbed by your views/religion/clothing/public defecation, satisfying your preference to act in that way is more important than others' annoyance (in these cases)."]

For context, I'm AMAB and I've been questioning for about a year, now embracing parts of transition and leaning towards normal medical and social transition in the future.", 'Here are some observations/opinions from my life: it seems that gender identity is largely social and mostly a choice, but it’s heavily motivated by gender dysphoria, an innate and immutable psychological condition. Almost every trans person ""chooses"" to change name/pronouns, but nobody chooses to feel an intense discomfort towards their primary and secondary sex characteristics or towards their treatment within society as a particular gender. I wasn’t born my preferred gender, I was born with a condition eventually resulting in strong distress with my sex and gender. This point of view doesn’t seem too uncommon, but it’s not pushed externally, probably because bigots w/o nuance can easily take it as an admission that trans people are just ~mentally ill~. Even if it isn’t universally agreed upon, the point of view that gender is an essential characteristic to a person is politically attractive, which is why I’d guess it’s pushed so much.', 'On the rest of your post: when has anybody suggested that being trans automatically changes your sex? Medical transition can change one’s sex to a reasonable degree (obviously, via changes to hormones and several sexual characteristics), but I don’t think any reasonable activists have suggested that a change to one’s gender always implies a change to one’s sex.', 'Honestly, I see all of the inane comparisons to trans-*ism as equivocation between identities which fly in the face of an obvious biological reality (granting for the sake of discussion that race is an obvious biological reality) and identities which don’t really say anything about biology. Imo it all boils down to the assertions that gender and sex are different, that gender bends by almost definition to one’s feelings, and that sex can be partially changed via methods already common for trans people.']

['#1140 For the love of christ, if you don’t like trans women, no one is forcing you to sleep with them. Unless you’re posting bc you want people to challenge your view, this whole conversation seems unproductive and bad to have over the internet. Please stop. There are plenty of people who would not sleep with me, as a tall girl, and if I had to wade through a fuck ton of confessions about that, it would be really hurtful to me. You don’t go around saying, “I wouldn’t sleep with you” to people! Try it, folks, see how far it gets you! You wouldn’t say to Carrie (for example because she has been commenting, and also because she is a freshman girl and it is upsetting for me to see such a young woman feel attacked like this in a public forum) “I wouldn’t sleep with you,” even if you wouldn’t, BECAUSE SHE ALSO PROBABLY DOESN’T WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU (like most women don’t if you have an attitude like that, tbh), AND IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT MATTER ABOUT US WOMEN OTHER THAN OUR FUCKABILITY. And also, if she were interested in you, you would be damn lucky, she’s a delightful girl. But even if she were not, she and others like her do not deserve this treatment on confessions. Maybe just don’t spew hate. Like there are groups that I am prejudiced against but I don’t go around advertising it and I try not to let it affect my interactions with them. How hard is that? Also, bonus round: why do you think it is that we police trans WOMEN on their sexual desirability... oh look, misogyny, my old friend, come to tell women we only are valuable insofar as we turn people on! Turns out our trans sisters reveal a special strain of the hate directed against women more generally! Yay winning. Ugh.']

["#1096 Unpopular opinion: Roe v Wade is a garbage SCOTUS decision. The deciding factor was that restricting or banning access to abortion is a violation of an implied right to privacy given by the Fourteenth Amendment. But the Fourteenth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Declaration of Independence explicitly argue that everyone has a right to life. I prefer that these documents be interpreted according to their text and the intentions of the people who wrote them at the time. I can guarantee that none of the Founding Fathers thought that abortion was even remotely okay. Call me a textualist and an originalist (or a strict constructionist if that term's still used), but the idea of the courts stretching these documents beyond their words and intent is scary to me. It basically gives the Supreme Court a legislative power even though the Supreme Court is part of the judicial branch and not the legislative branch. (I have the same problem with executive orders FWIW).", "If you want to argue that it's applicable in cases of rape or incest (which comprise a very small minority of abortions in America), fine. But I consider a developing baby in the womb to be a person, no matter what stage of development they're in. Let's focus on the overwhelming majority of abortions, where a woman had consensual sex. Ladies, if you're going to have sex (especially unprotected), you should be old enough and mature enough to understand the risks and to handle getting pregnant and giving birth if it happens. You don't get to kill another living being growing inside you just because you made a bad sexual decision or a mistake. It's called taking responsibility for your body.", 'Oh, and I\'m female, so don\'t even fucking think of saying that I\'m ""mansplaining"" or trying to control women\'s bodies.

["#1039 I'm a rising senior and I'm realizing that tbh I really hate the way I've been interacting with people for the past couple years here. I really like to be helpful and I'm worried that if I can't be useful to others then they won't want me around ever but that has sort of morphed into my consideration for others being constantly taken for granted. I've started to notice that people take advantage of my willingness to help low-key all the time and then turn around and treat me like shit or take credit for my work or both. When I tell people that this makes me uncomfortable then I'm suddenly a massive bitch or a needy credit whore. I just want the time I put into my work and my friendships to mean something but I've come to understand that no one cares about me as a person unless I'm helping them out. I also had a few notable falling-outs with people last year and my core group of friends all decided that they didn't want to hang around me anymore and started leaving me out of everything while still finding ways to rub that in my face or ask me for favors. Let it be said that I never bothered them with my issues and have also been called on in the past to counsel them through their own shit. Last semester I had a couple days where I was done with the people in my living group doing this and was distant (not smiling or waving). Several of my friends got together to talk about how I was a huge fucking problem. At this point I realized that any emotion I express that isn't perfectly happy and smiling is seen as a character defect, that people leaving me out or saying legitimately cruel things is to be expected and any issue I take with that is also a character defect, and the incredible amount of effort I put into making sure the people around me are okay is expected behavior and nothing to be noticed or mentioned ever. I'm really sorry for the long rambling confession and thanks for making it all the way through my shitty paragraph. I know that this isn't like a huge world problem and I'm sorry for bothering people with my relatively minor issues but I just wanted to get this off my chest and I think that's what confessions is for. All in all, I'm willing to take responsibility for things that I've handled poorly or times that I've lashed out or been frustrated but I'm sick and tired that my patience and kindness are both exploited and ignored.", "tl;dr people suck and i'm done"]

As I understand, the whole point of believing the survivor is to allow victims to be open about their stories so that perpetrators can be held accountable - right now there can be cases where simply an accusation, even an accusation proven to be completely false, comes with the immediate social and career damning of the accused prior to an investigation, and that surely is not the intention of Me Too.']

Quit trying to solve problems from the outside looking in. I'll tell you right now the problem is not motivation. It is not lack of information. It's MIT charging more for cost of housing than we make from a full time job and food in this area costing an ungodly amount. You see those videos about people spending half their money on rent? I spend over 100% on housing and literally don't have a dime for food. People all over campus are put in similar situations as this by MIT's stingy pay and their ridiculous fees.

For a friendship to begin, there usually needs to be some sort of shared emotional experience (doesn't have to be super emotional though, just enough to evoke positive feelings) to provide the initial basis for an emotional connection. Then over time you continue to engage in positive emotional activities with the other person (pursuing your own interests in a social context is a good starter way to do this), strengthening the connection, and at some point, also engage regarding past individual emotional experiences and often, connect via empathy (if you're empathy is not super developed, don't worry, you can learn) which produces more positive feelings associated with you and at this point, you've probably formed a social attachment."]

(Although I'm sure reasons for being a bad summer texter vary.)", "I personally find that it takes a lot of energy and focus for me to integrate new stimuli, and usually the summer is a period where a LOT of new stimuli has to be integrated relatively quickly (new work, new location, new people, etc.) and that tends to take up all of my energy to the point that I have a really hard time putting energy into maintaining any of the relationships that I value because I'm so exhausted. When I first came to MIT, it was the same way, and I really neglected my family relationships and the relationships I valued with friends from home for the first six months or so before I had enough of a handle on my new environment to be able to put energy into those relationships again. Once I get through this adjustment period, I absolutely want to maintain and grow those relationships, I just usually don't make it to other side of that adjustment period over the summer. Tbh, the first few months after I graduate, I probably will be mostly off the grid in most of my relationships, but after I get past those first few months, I'll pop back up and it doesn't mean that I don't value the relationship!"]

Our students stop and pick up roadkill so they have something to eat (I have too), but for some reason African Americans who are richer and have far better resources get a step up because of an ""impoverished group"" status. Nearly any argument used for affirmative action also applies to groups of white Americans in the Ohio Valley, central Appalachians, and other places that have been impoverished for generations.', "None of these lawsuits are arguing that we shouldn't preferentially admit people who scored lower on standardized tests but who have limited education access, the are only arguing that we shouldn't generalize this way based on race.", "Also, this realistically won't change that much about how elite schools admit applicants, as they can just substitute lack of access and tenacity/work ethic instead of race.

['#780 OP of the post asking why there are a few obsessive commenters in confessions thread, I’ve had some time to think about the topic since then and would like to present my hypothesis —', 'First, some key observations -', '1. The original post got responses from the ‘subjects’ such as “it’s not deep” and “it doesn’t take much time” (vis-à-vis the comments). Surely, that’s not a satisfactory reason. Amount of time something takes isn’t a explanation for doing it in the first place, and there are many more followers on the page so that begs the question why only these few people.\n2. Majority (>90%) of the subjects’ comments are extremely left/liberal leaning.\n3. And now for a controversial statement, but one that is central to my hypothesis - most of the subjects aren’t very attractive/pretty (in the usual sense of the word.)\n4. Social validation is an innate human desire and social media often provides a platform for seeking the same.', 'Hypothesis - There are two ways of unlocking likes at scale on social media - either by being pretty or witty. Since most of the subjects aren’t very pretty, their only other option is being witty.', 'This is why you see the subjects often trying to out-smart, out-intellect, out-wit, out-moral other posts on confession. A tinge of virtue-signaling completes the recipe for likes and heart reacts. Reciprocity is also included (known as circle-jerking in common parlance). This relates to point 2 since in the college climate of social media, liberal values are already accepted and rewarded, thus incentivizing the types of comments we see.', 'Of course much of this behavior is sub-consciously assimilated, and therefore the subjects display a lack of self-awareness for their behavioral-pattern (see point 1).', 'The subjects have figured out the key to social media validation that works for them and I believe their behavior, at least partly, can be explained by my conjecture.', '(PS- I’m aware this is going to be attacked by my subjects as this clearly would hurt their ego, though I’d hope better arguments that refute central points made here rather than the typical ad-hominem, straw-mans, and attacking the tone.)']

['#636 According to Confucius, being filial to our parents is the utmost expression of respect. This is an essential element in obtaining the title of chun-tzu, or noble person. However, filial piety is not a one-way street. Parents must also be filial to their children and to their parents. Both parent and child have a natural position and responsibility within the family; therefore natural filial piety is reciprocal. It is through recognizing and practicing filial piety in the family that a person will know how to act outside of the family. For in the Confucian tradition, it is realized that filial piety also exists between all beings. This is evident in the Confucian Golden Rule, which is sometimes referred to as the Silver Rule: "Do not do unto others what you would want them to not do unto you.']

When I was younger and my parents fought constantly, I used to have those images as well and I would often cry myself to sleep because I knew I don't have the guts in me to do anything close to what I was imaging. It was comforting, for sure - at least take my mind off the background noise and the complicated emotions circulating in the house. But, when I later look back on it, it was a clear sign that I was suffering through some sort of anxiety and depression.", "I am not saying that you may have anxiety and/or depression, but having vivid images of yourself attempting suicide is not great to your state of mind. When life hits me in the face, after dwelling in negative emotions, I force myself to look realistically at my situation and what I can do to get myself back on my feet. If I can't see anything at first, I keep on thinking and thinking and do something (who knows pick up a book to read, watch tv shows, go outside and treat myself to some Starbucks drink, etc) so that I can get things moving. I believe that I can move away from the negative space that I found myself in by doing simple things that will get me moving even when I can't see the way out."]

['#515 I swear, nothing annoys me more than when people act like pro-life people are trying to ""control women\'s bodies"". Literally nobody thinks that. No pro-life proponent is trying to control my body. That\'s such an unbelievably fringe opinion. It\'s one of the most hilariously obvious straw man arguments I\'ve ever seen (second only to some of Trump\'s arguments). It\'s an indication of how little the left actually thinks about opposing arguments. Acting like the abortion issue has something to do with ""women\'s rights"" is so far removed from the crux of the argument, that it just shrouds their whole side in illegitimacy. The entire damn argument is nothing more than ""do fetuses have moral value, and thus cannot be killed because that\'d be murder; or do they not have moral value, and thus can be killed at any time; or perhaps a grey area where they\'re have some moral value, more than zero but less than a living human, and so can be killed under certain sets of circumstances."" Women\'s rights are not a part of that discussion, except perhaps in the last case (which isn\'t the pro-life case, of course). If you\'re pro-life, you\'re pro life because you think it\'s immoral to kill unborn babies, not because of some weird ass idea that you want to control women.', 'This idea that pro-life people are trying to control women\'s bodies is not only preposterous and ignorant, but it\'s just plain fucking insulting. I\'m certainly a feminist, and I demand full control over my own body, but I\'m still pro-life because I believe that a baby inside of me is NOT ""my body"". It\'s the baby\'s body which happens to be inside me. I don\'t get to just go murdering it because I don\'t want it to be alive anymore, regardless of my reason for wanting it gone.', "By all means, there certainly are very reasonable arguments for abortion that I do find compelling (like abortion after a rape, I'll admit that one makes me feel very conflicted about my position), but you hurling insulting straw man arguments at me to belittle the validity of my opinion is not the way to go, people.", 'P.S. also annoying is when people accuse me of being brainwashed or manipulated because I\'m a female pro-life supporter. I\'m a grown woman, I can make my own fucking opinions. You call yourself a feminist, but imply that my opinions must not be my own just because I\'m a woman? Fuck you."']

['#504 tl;dr: @men, invest in your sexual desirability as much as the average woman does, and you will attract sexual partners nearly as easily as the average woman.', "@472 I do understand why it would seem like it is much harder for a man to attract female sexual partners, because the average heterosexual man does probably attract far fewer sexual partners than the average heterosexual woman. But what most men don't seem to understand is that the reason it's much easier for the average woman to attract a man is because the average woman puts soooooo much more time, energy, and money into being sexually desirable than the average man does.", 'If you\'re a man going ""poor me, it\'s not fair, it\'s so easy for women to have sex,"" ask yourself when was the last time you plucked your eyebrows? Waxed something, if your appearance would benefit from that (which for most people, it would)? Have you figured out exactly what clothes are flattering to your body and do you almost exclusively wear those? Have you figured out the most flattering haircut and styling for you? What about your facial hair? What\'s your skincare routine like? (And washing your face and mayyybe using moisturizing does not a skincare routine make.)', 'The average woman has done all these things (well, except facial hair styling) and much, much more. If you want to attract sexual partners with the ease of the average woman, then invest as much in your sexual desirability as the average woman. If you do this, you will probably have an even larger selection of partners than the average woman, because men who bother to do this are so scarce.', "So yeah, it may seem like it's easier for women to attract sexual partners (and this would probably still be slightly true regardless, because slut shaming means fewer women are down for casual sex, and men are less likely to be worried that a hookup is going to murder them), but mostly I think it's just that women as a population invest so much more in their sexual desirability than men (and yes, that is including forms of investing in one's sexual desirability other than physical appearance, but that's a whole different rant)."]

Colleges are actively discriminating against them for seemingly no reason other than to admit other students of different races to promote diversity. Which is not a bad thing in and of itself.

Instead, they should promote diversity of thought not diversity of skin color. Just my 2 cents. Have at it in the comments. - signed a cishet white male.']

Test tutors are undeniably a privilege for those who can afford it, and plenty of asian-american families can't.\nI'm not saying that asian american students don't get some benefit from a highly pro-academic culture, but this culture only developed among asian-american communities because strong academics are viewed as the least subjective way to prove that an asian-american is worth giving a job/scholarship/opportunity to. This culture is in place precisely to ward off discrimination, not because asians are innately pro-education from birth. Also a reminder that many asian-american families push education to an abusive extent, and many (not all) successful asian-american students have been physically and emotionally abused over their academic performance throughout their childhood.\nIt's easy to say you wish your parents pushed you when you were a kid, or you wish you grew up in an asian-american culture of education if you haven't faced getting beaten and screamed at daily for not doing well enough in academic competitions.", "There are plenty of asian-americans who are low-income, have faced discrimination over their race, and/or come from abusive backgrounds.

It\'s easy to keep your chin up when you\'re better than the people who hurt you in certain metrics, but when you\'re inferior in every way to everyone around you, it\'s really hard to have any scrap of self-confidence left.']

['#338 I think it\'s lazy af to subscribe to a rhetoric that leans left or right instead of getting to the heart of complex answers to find the correct answer. They state a rule and then say "oh except for ____." A lot of undecided people politically see this and are regularly conflicted by the nuances and aren\'t quick to just repeat whatever they heard on their favorite media outlet. Then to assure yourself you didn\'t oversimplify the problem you keep screaming louder. And louder. If you side either way and don\'t see you\'re buying into a distraction that just pushes conflict down the road then my god we are fucked. Whole system needs to be redone if you ask me, right down to the ideologies that built it']

I\'m pointing out how fucked you all are and you\'re just making it easier with your garbage arguments. What I\'m trying to say is unless you all are comfortable with people talking about starving without attacking them u shouldn\'t say a damn word to defend these people baraginy confessions with "Im gaining weight poor me". Nobody says shit to them but ppl attack someone starving. The narrative is set to attack poor']

["#293 I'm curious about how much people usually spend on food each week and how much is considered a lot/starving. I've been comfortably eating on $20 a week for some time now, $25 if you count transportation (and plus some small things like olive oil and a bag of rice that I bought at the start of the year). I was worse off in the fall and spent around $10-$15 per week but I was by no means starving, although I did take advantage of consistent free food sources on campus (fruit, ramen, coffee) if I ran out of food. Some people react to this like it's a tiny amount but I'm still quite healthy and keeping a consistent weight. What's a lot or a little? I'm interested in some context."]
