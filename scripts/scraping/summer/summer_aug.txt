I’ve had a rough ass year, seen my GPA take a shit, relapsed into self harm, tried to kill myself a couple times, but none of that matters anymore. I have a bomb ass girlfriend, I’ve held my career together, my family and friends are fucking proud of me for staying alive and making it this far, and no matter all the mistakes I made in this life or how many speed bumps I’ve hit, everything has led me up to this moment. Standing by a boat’s railing, drinking a beer or two, listening to the music in the air. Somehow I made it.']

I’m a picture perfect testament to how people a year above you can exploit the fact you have no idea how college is like, and manipulate and control your social circle because you have no idea what -normal- is yet. It sounds condescending but it’s true. My ex partner would literally go around telling people how much she liked dating a freshman because “he’s so easy to control” We were wanting to go into the same industry for work, So my friendships depended on her, my networking depended on her, my access to social scenes around campus depended on her, everything did. Imagine the environment that creates, that your “partner” can do whatever the hell they want to you, because if you leave, you lose everything connected to MIT around you, because that person had their hands in every part of their life for the sole fact that they’ve been here longer than you have.']

Though I admit I had a bit of an advantage as I had done a little coding in the past, and also my PRL papers weren't super impressive, like probably not good enough to guarantee tenure or get nominated for a Nobel Prize in Physics or anything.

For HASS I decided to balance it out and take 21M.301 which was pretty easy for me since I already been doing music. Despite having a UROP which ended up with a publication in ICML, I ended up getting almost all As and A+ grades though in 6.438 I somehow managed to get a B+ (fml right?). Tbh I am not even that smart its just that its over-exagerated by many people how difficult these classes are - theyre hard of course but doable. I didnt even have any of the pre-reqs and hadnt written a line of code before. Maybe thats why I got a B+ in 438. It was all good though since it was just my first semester and was on PNR.']

["#2244 The other day (8/23) there was a ton of free food in building 66. Quite a few people showed up, but there was plenty to go around. Then an East Campus resident showed up and piled up 3 platters (there was a 2nd person with him, cannot recall if they took anything too), close to half of the food available. Several people tried to stop him from doing so, explaining that he was taking food from others streaming from across campus. He left anyway. I just wanted to tell that person: you are despicable. Sure, you're taking the food not only for yourself, so that might make you feel less selfish. But to use the free food mailing list as a personal catering service for you community is basically stealing food from the mouths of the hungriest people on campus. It's one thing if you're doing so naively, but to continue doing so over in-person protests is disturbing."]

On his birthday, I was waiting for him, to give him a big hug, but it seemed like he was avoiding me. Then my patience came to an end. I asked him what had happened, and he told me that he tried to make the love go away. He said he wanted to be just friends, but it was hard for him. He said that nothing was going to be the same, that he'll try to treat me better, but he won't be the guy who was in love with me. We started fighting a lot. We would fight and then act as if everything was fine, and we'd talk as cute as we used to, but then fight again. Eventually, on Christmas eve, we had a huge fight because of something really stupid, which he considered something really important. And I tried to fix the situation, while he was blaming me for making it worse. I texted him 4-5 times, with periods between them, and then I gave up, because he wouldn't try. Time passed, and it was really hard for me. I missed him a lot, as he was my everything. But he seemed alright without me. I wanted him to feel what I felt, to suffer the way I suffered. I wanted him to realize he couldn't live without me. But he didn't do anything. After a month or more he texted me, and my heart was beating really fast, but I acted cool. The conversation didn't last long. As time passed, I started feeling that I hate him. It took me a lot of time to get over him. But even now, when I see him happy without me, I get jealous. I just wanted him to fight for me. What if I'd love him back?"]

['#1705 Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n... But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\nAnd one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.”\n—Milton Mayer, *They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45*']

Now that I've come to MIT and learned a lot more about sex, I'm slowly realizing how insanely problematic my last high school relationship was, in terms of lack of consent and wildly inappropriate sexual overstepping. Now that I know how much stuff was done to me that was very not okay, I've felt increasingly violated and instinctively wary of committing to another relationship. But I also feel a bit unjustified, because what I felt when these things actually happened was a fraction of what I feel now, and it's like changing my mind after the fact which is unfair or something. Idk. Anybody else have similar experiences?"]

['#1864 One thing I don\'t understand about myself is how I cannot handle loneliness *at all*. I\'ve been trying for years to get over it, trying to be on my own for a bit to fully embrace myself. I have been seeing a therapist, taking meds, meditating, blah blah, but nothing is helping. Everytime I\'m left alone for more than half a day or I feel like I\'m being sidelined in a group, I rapidly fall into a depressive spiral to the point of suicidal ideation. As soon as I\'m around people who genuinely care about me, though, all of these thoughts and feelings just evaporate. I\'ve somehow managed to survive this far by desperately trying to surround myself with caring people, but sometimes they\'re not around, and I just lack the charm or overall ""interestingness"" to get close to many people. I don\'t know what to do. I can\'t tell my therapist because I\'m certain I\'ll get involuntarily hospitalized, and that won\'t really solve anything.', "I'm just constantly at war with my mind—this is definitely one thing I would want to change about myself if I could. Just accepting it is out of the question because I'll just cop out and end up dead."]

['#2209 It\'s very very scary how sex clouds people\'s minds. So much advertising revolves around evocative sexual imagery, which apparently gets people to buy stuff well enough that ""sex sells"" is a standard. People will do horrible things like rape a friend, just driven by a desire to fuck. Women are groped in broad public daylight just because what, some creep wants to touch a boob that bad? Imagine if suddenly grabbing a stranger\'s arm or face in public was normalized, or treated as somewhat understandable, like groping is. As an asexual, I don\'t think I can ever understand the raw power that sex has on people, and floating through a world where the vast majority of people are driven by this thing I can\'t understand is really\nterrifying. Any fellow aces have thoughts about this?']

["#2069 I'm currently in California till I'm back in Boston and there's one thing I honestly don't get. How can California and its citizens claim to be so liberal if this state has such large homeless epidemic in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and in other places? It's really disappointing to see that a state that prides itself with being so progressive cannot even provide housing for the most disadvantaged in our society. Ironically a lot of wealthy techies are partly responsible for this situation. I really hope that Silicon Valley's wealthy techies stand up for the homeless if they have any moral conscience at all."]
