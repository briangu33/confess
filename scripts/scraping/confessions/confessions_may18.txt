['#13652 I just got out of an incredibly abusive relationship but my ex is in our friend group and no one knows. I want to share my voice and my story if possible, anonymously because he is moving on from this too and I don’t need to ruin his life, but I’d love to know if my story could help other girls in this situation, because it’s complicated and I could relate. Any ideas?']

['#13617 ____ is a man whore, and I don’t understand why multiple women would ever be into such an awful scumbag, let alone fight over his attention. He’s not even good looking. Any woman who even thinks about being with that horrible man needs to re-evaluate their life. He’s not worth your sadness. He’s not worth a single thing. He’s not worth this confession, but all the women who he has hurt are worth it. He makes a terrible name for his friends and his frat, and I honestly hope everyone just realizes what a fuck he is and removes him from their lives.']

["#13607 WH, I truly did think that you were going to save me from this world of stunted, selfish men with no sense of responsibility for others. Who don't take initiative in cooking or cleaning for others, who don't share their feelings openly, who have typical algorithmic responses to everything, no intriguing thoughts, who can't accept a no, who check out other women and think its normal. From having to settle. From having to take on a nagging maternal caretaker role. From feeling unequal. From having a basic ass relationship. I really felt that, I believed it, I saw it."]
