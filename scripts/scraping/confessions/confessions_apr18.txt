["#13441 These physics exams are perfect examples of why people get so stressed out and concerned for their academic success. If a fundamental sophomore physics course has a 45 test average, how are people expected to display any mastery of the material for an absolutely unrealistically difficult exam? And if you post a distribution the day of the exam where the average is a 45, you better expect that people will be pretty fucking anxious about seeing their grades. When you wait 5 days without any updates on grading, people are going to be pretty spooked and will consider dropping the course. Most of us aren't the pure math kids who took the advanced version of this class in 6th grade and sail by with a 97 average. We're trying to learn physics but are too busy getting dicked on by these horrific exams."]

Being a wimp and doing nice things expecting to woo her only to find out she doesn't like you is your fault. Could have saved a lot of time and effort if you had the confidence to tell her sooner. Girls, you're not entitled to being treated like a princess. If you date an asshole, you should have seen clear cut signs early on he has no intention of changing for you, but you ignored it. That's on you, not the guy. Bottom line for both scenarios is you cannot force someone to do something they don't want to do. Love is a two way street. If the person doesn't feel the same way, get over it and move on. The longer you remain attached, the worse it gets."]

['#13145 I do not want to walk at graduation this June. I think it\'s because I\'m not the slow down and smell the roses type. My family gave me the "How can you be so selfish?" lecture but I countered by saying "Who\'s more selfish? Me for wanting something that does not affect you at all? Or you for wanting me to do something I don\'t want to do just so you can have a good time?" Let\'s face it, we\'re all selfish when it comes to certain things, but my family was more selfish because they wanted me to do something I don\'t want to do. Sometimes, you need to put yourself first and this is exactly what I\'m doing.']

["#13414 I came to MIT to find a place to die. Why? I don't know. I wanted to find a place where no one really knew, so if I died, I wouldn't matter. I still haven't but I waver between accepting this amazing place, and dragging myself to the chopping block. What do you think? Do I finish what I started?"]

I see a lot of so-called communists and socialists around the US and even at MIT. I even heard there was a communist book store near Harvard. Should I just assume that most people are anti-communist?']
