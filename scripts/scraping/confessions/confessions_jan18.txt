['#11447 I love dogs so much. There are not enough doggos at MIT. All I want are some nice puppers to pet. Big ones, Lil ones, Fluffy guys, Hairless guys, Short pups, Tall pups, you name it im in. Dogs are mans best friend after all and I think everyone can use some more friends. Also another concern are doggos ok in this weather? And if not who wants to start knitting or sewing or making of some kind dog sweaters and booties with me. The cold puppers need our help! But most importantly please share your puppers with true MIT community stranded in the cold many miles away from their own best friends. So if you have a doge open to petting please comment below and i’m sure flocks of people myself included will show up. 🐶🐕']

International students seem to appear significantly stronger on average to a university admissions committee (both undergrad and grad) due to lots of us having shiny Olympiad medals and other achievements that's hard to get in the USA, but lack many essential things that make a student valuable as an intern / hire for a company. Plus a lot of international course 6's are sellouts from course 18 who realize they have no future in math since they are poorly prepared for the rigor, when compared to the non-international course 18's."]
