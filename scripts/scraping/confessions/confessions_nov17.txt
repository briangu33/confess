['#9801 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Robert A. Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Weinberg‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they‚Äôre not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg‚Äôs lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúIn contradistinction,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ', 'And yes, by the way, i DO have a Robert A. Weinberg tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé']

At the same time, the last couple people I have been into have demonstrated really kind hearts and fun attitudes , _and_ I find them attractive. Unfortunately sometimes the muddle of jokes and discussion make me feel bad about liking them just because they happen to be asian...']

She'll get upset if I make plans to hang out with other people and when I invite her, she'll make my friends uncomfortable by acting surly and doesn't attempt to make conversation. She complains a lot about everything--her classes, the people around her, her friends and family back home, even small insignificant things! She always wants to be around me and it's mentally and emotionally exhausting to deal with her all the time. I think she acts this way because she doesn't have many friends, but I don't want to be around her all the time with since it's really starting to have a negative impact on daily mood. I plan on moving out next year but I'd appreciate some advice to help me until then."]

I\'ve always prided myself on being there for my friends though, and as someone who also struggles with mental health, I really want to be there for my friends who struggle with theirs. But I\'m realizing it\'s just not sustainable or practical. I\'m only taking 4 classes and I\'ve become minimally involved in extracurriculars, yet I still feel like I constantly have to work and study to get the grades I want. I\'m becoming like the people here who prioritize school over friends, people I always used to resent and complain about. Makes me feel hypocritical. IHTFP.
